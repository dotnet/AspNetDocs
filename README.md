# ASP.NET Docs

This repository contains the conceptual ASP.NET 4.x documentation hosted at [docs.microsoft.com/aspnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet). See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues list](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetDocs/issues) if you would like to help out.

API documentation changes should be made in the [ApiDocs repository](https://github.com/aspnet/ApiDocs) against the triple slash `///` comments.
