> [!NOTE]
> Since this article was written, the ASP.NET Membership providers have been superseded by [ASP.NET Identity](/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity). We strongly recommend updating apps to use the [ASP.NET Identity](/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity) platform rather than the Membership providers featured at the time this article was written. ASP.NET Identity has a number of advantages over the ASP.NET Membership system, including :
>
> * More secure.
> * More preformant.
> * Improved testability.
> * Support for two-factor authentication.
> * More features.
