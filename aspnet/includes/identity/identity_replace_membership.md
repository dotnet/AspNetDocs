> [!NOTE]
> Since this article was written, the ASP.NET Membership providers have been superseded by [ASP.NET Identity](/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity). We strongly recommend updating apps to use the [ASP.NET Identity](/aspnet/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity) platform rather than the Membership providers featured at the time this article was written. ASP.NET Identity has a number of advantages over the ASP.NET Membership system, including :
>
> * Better performance
> * Improved extensibility and testability
> * Support for OAuth, OpenID Connect, and two-factor authentication
> * Claims-based Identity support
> * Better interoperability with ASP.Net Core
