Consider using [ASP.NET Core web API](/aspnet/core/web-api). It has the following advantages over ASP.NET 4.x Web API:

* ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web apps on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* The ASP.NET Core MVC controllers and web API controllers are unified.
* Architected for testability.
* Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Open-source and community-focused.
* Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
* A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
* Built-in dependency injection.
* A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
* Ability to host on [Kestrel](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel), [IIS](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/index), [HTTP.sys](xref:fundamentals/servers/httpsys), [Nginx](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-nginx), [Apache](xref:host-and-deploy/linux-apache), and [Docker](xref:host-and-deploy/docker/index).
* Side-by-side versioning.
* Tooling that simplifies modern web development.
