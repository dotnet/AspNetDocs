> [!NOTE]
> An updated version of this tutorial is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc) using the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). The new tutorial uses [ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/), which provides **many** improvements over this tutorial.
>
> This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC with controllers and views. Razor Pages is a new alternative in ASP.NET Core 2.0, a page-based programming model that makes building web UI easier and more productive. We recommend you try the [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages) tutorial before the MVC version. The Razor Pages tutorial:
> * Is easier to follow.
> * Covers more features.
> * Is the preferred approach for new application development.
