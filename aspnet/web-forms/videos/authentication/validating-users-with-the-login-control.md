# Validating Users with the Login Control

by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

In this video, Joe Stagner explores an alternative method of user authentication rather then creating a custom form and calling the API to authenticate a user. He uses the Login Control that ships with ASP.NET 2 and above. For additional information about this video, read the "Validating User Credentials Against the Membership User Store" security tutorial ([C#](../../overview/older-versions-security/membership/validating-user-credentials-against-the-membership-user-store-cs.md), [VB](../../overview/older-versions-security/membership/validating-user-credentials-against-the-membership-user-store-vb.md)).
