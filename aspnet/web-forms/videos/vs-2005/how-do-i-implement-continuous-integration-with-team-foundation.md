# [How Do I:] Implement Continuous Integration with Team Foundation?

by [Chris Menegay](https://twitter.com/CMenegay)

There are a number of continuous integration tools that work on top of Team Foundation Server, and in this video we look at the free [Norton TeamCI](http://teamsystemrocks.com/files/12/tools/entry1018.aspx) tool available from [Team System Rocks](http://teamsystemrocks.com/). TeamCI periodically checks whether updated files have been checked in to Team Foundation Server and, if so, will build the solution and run any automated tests.
