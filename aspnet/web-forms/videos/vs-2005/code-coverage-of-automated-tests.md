# Code Coverage of Automated Tests

by Eric Lee

This video demonstrates how to use code coverage as a metric for determining how effective our testing is of an ASP.NET Web application. After a test has completed, Visual Studio Team System reports on the percentage of code that was executed and indicates executed code with a green background and unexecuted code with a red background, making it easy to see the code that was covered by the test. You will also learn how you can use C# or Visual Basic to extend the automated test.
