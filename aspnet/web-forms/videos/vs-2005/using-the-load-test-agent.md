# Using the Load Test Agent

by Eric Lee

In this video we examine how to incorporate the Load Test Agent in to the testing that we do with Visual Studio Team System. A Load Test Agent is part of a "rig" that can be deployed to separate machines to enable load, stress, and unit testing from another operating system or machine configuration. Each rig can work with several agents and can be deployed to virtual or remote machines, allowing for comprehensive testing with Visual Studio Team System.
