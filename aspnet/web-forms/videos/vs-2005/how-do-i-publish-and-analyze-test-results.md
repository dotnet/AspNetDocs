# [How Do I:] Publish and Analyze Test Results?

by [Chris Menegay](https://twitter.com/CMenegay)

Visual Studio Team System enables you to chart changes in a project's code quality as the project progresses. This video provides instructions on how to publish test results to the Team Foundation Server project database and associate the results with a build number. We see that after the results are published we can use the Report Manager to view a graphical representation of changes in our build test results.
