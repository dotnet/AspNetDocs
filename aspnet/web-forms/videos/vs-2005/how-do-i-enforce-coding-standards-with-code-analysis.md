# [How Do I:] Enforce Coding Standards with Code Analysis?

by [Chris Menegay](https://twitter.com/CMenegay)

With Visual Studio Team System you have fine control over the code analysis rules that apply to class library projects, web site projects, and source code control. In this video we learn how to specify the errors and warnings that will apply during project builds and code check ins, and we see how to suppress a particular rule from applying to a specific class member. With this configurability you can enforce coding standards to improve the quality of your code, while ensuring inapplicable rules never get in your way.
