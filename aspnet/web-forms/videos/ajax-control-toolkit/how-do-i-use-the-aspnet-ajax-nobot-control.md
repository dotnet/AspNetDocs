# [How Do I:] Use the ASP.NET AJAX NoBot Control?

by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

The NoBot control from the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit helps prevent certain types of unauthorized access to your Web applications. In this video we see how the NoBot control provides a number of built-in guards against automated access, including checking the number and frequency of form submissions. We also see how the control allows the developer to define a custom challenge, such as a JavaScript test that will succeed only if the page is viewed in a browser.
