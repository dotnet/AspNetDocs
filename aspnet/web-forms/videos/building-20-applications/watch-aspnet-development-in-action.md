# Watch ASP.NET Development in Action

by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

Watch how easy it is to build a "to do" task list application from scratch using ASP.NET 2.0, ASP.NET AJAX, SQL Server Express, and Visual Web Developer. Microsoft's Joe Stagner starts by creating a fresh database and the code to access its data. We then see how to define a ToDo List page that displays and updates content in the database. Finally we learn how to add AJAX functionality to the page to improve the user experience.
