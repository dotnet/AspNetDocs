by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will demonstrate how to create a custom user control in ASP.NET that can be used throughout a web site or across many web sites. Start out by learning the basics of creating a user control that will be used in multiple pages including validation, controlling formatting using style elements, and loading/saving data for the user interface elements. Throughout the video considerations for building user controls that can be easily maintained and used across multiple pages are discussed.
