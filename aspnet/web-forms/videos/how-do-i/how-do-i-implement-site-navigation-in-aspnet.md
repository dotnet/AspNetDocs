# [How Do I:] Implement Site Navigation in ASP.NET?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video we learn how to define a sitemap and use it with the Menu, TreeView, and Sitemap server controls. We see how to use a sitemap on a master page for site-wide menus and how we can have single or multiple sitemaps on a page. In addition, we are shown how to integrate a sitemap with ASP.NET roles by using "security trimming" to dynamically show or hide menu options for users with different access levels.
