# [How Do I:] Use Cascading Style Sheets for Web Page Layout?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video we learn how to use `<div>` elements in combination with cascading style sheets (CSS) to create robust and higher performance web pages. The `<div>`based approach will be compared to the `<table>` based layout approach used by most web sites over recent years. Then, several CSS-based approaches will be shown, ranging from absolute positioning to floating elements. We also learn the benefits of separating structural HTML from design with the use of CSS.
