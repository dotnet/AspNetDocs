# [How Do I:] Use the Fixednames Option with the Compiler Utility for Maximum Flexibility

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to use the fixednames option with the aspnet\_compiler.exe utility to produce a consistent file names in compilation output. First, see how the compilation output of the aspnet\_compiler.exe utility generates output files for an ASP.NET web site that represent the different components including pages, themes, and the folders in the site. See how the components are named and what they contain in relation to the original web site. Then, see how to use the fixednames option to standardize the output file names based upon the source files upon which they are based. Next, learn about considerations for using each of the compilation options when deploying updates to compiled web site, focusing on which components are most likely to be updated.
