# [How Do I]: Use the ASP.NET Cache Object to Cache Application Information

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to use the ASP.NET Cache object to store application information. A sample page is created with a simple user interface and code is added that populates the grid with data from an XML disk file. Then the code is revised to cache the data in the application Cache object after it is initially retrieved and read from the cache for subsequent requests. Finally, methods are added to make use of absolute and sliding time based dependency for the cached object.
