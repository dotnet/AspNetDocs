# How Do I: Create and Use Classes in JavaScript?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to create classes in JavaScript with functionality similar to other programming languages with object oriented capabilities. First a sample web site project is created with an external JavaScript file. A function() is created and the difference between using the function as a "function" and as a class constructor with the "new" keyword is discussed. Then public properties are added to the class constructor as well as private variables. Next a separate function is created and assigned as a method to the class. Alternatively, the same method is shown as a function defined in the class constructor. Finally, a private class method is created and used within the class constructor.
