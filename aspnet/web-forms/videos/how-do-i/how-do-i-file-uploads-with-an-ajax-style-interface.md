# [How Do I:]  File Uploads with an AJAX Style Interface

by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

In this video I will demonstrate, using ASP.NET, an AJAX style of uploading files from the client machine to your server. I say AJAX style because there is actually a problem using AJAX to upload files. The video will demonstrate what I mean.
