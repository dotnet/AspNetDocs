In this video Chris Pels shows how to create and send an email in an ASP.NET web site. First, learn about the core classes in the System.Net.Mail namespace for sending mail in an ASP.NET web site. See how to create an email message using the MailMessage class including how to use the MailAddress class for the From address and how to include one or more To addresses.
