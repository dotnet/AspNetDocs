# [How Do I:] Create a Custom Profile Provider?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video we learn how to create a custom profile provider to store and retrieve data associated with a user profile in SQL Server tables separate from the standard ASP.NET membership provider's aspnet\_Profile table. The principles covered in this video will apply to creating profile providers for other databases like Access and Oracle. After learning how to create the custom profile provider we learn how to install the provider in a web site and see a demonstration of loading and saving profile data.
