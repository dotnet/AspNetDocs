# [How Do I:] Cache Portions of an ASP.NET Page

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to cache one or more portions of an ASP.NET page by implementing the OutputCache for user controls on the page. First, an ASP.NET page is created and cached using the OutputCache directive. Several user controls are then created and cached for different durations. The relationship between page cached duration and control cache duration is reviewed. The different criteria for caching controls are reviewed including an example of VaryByControl where nested user controls can control caching of their parent controls.
