# Read, Write, and Delete Cookies in ASP.NET

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to read, write, and delete cookies in an ASP.NET application. First, learn the basic operations for manipulating cookies. Then learn approaches to storing multiple values in a single cookie using name-value pairs called subkeys. Next, learn how to limit the scope of cookies to a particular application domain or folder. See how to modify values and expiration dates in existing cookies and how to delete an existing cookie. In addition, several considerations for using cookies are also discussed.
