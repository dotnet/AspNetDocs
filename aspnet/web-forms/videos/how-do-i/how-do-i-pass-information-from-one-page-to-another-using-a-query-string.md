# [How Do I:] Pass Information From One Page to Another Using a Query String

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how information can be passed from one page to another using a query string. First, see how to construct a query string including variable names and values from information on a data entry form. Next, see how to access the query string information when the page is posted including how multiple query string variables are handled. As part of the server side processing of query string information, see how to implement validation for existence of query string variables and if they contain the expected type of data. Finally, learn how to pass special characters including a space and an ampersand in a query string by encoding the string.
