# [How Do I:] Deploy a Web Site Using the Copy Web Site Tool

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels will show how to deploy a web site using the Copy Web Site Tool in Visual Studio. First see how to connect to a remote web site and deploy an entire site to the target location. Next, learn how to synchronize an entire source and target web site. In addition, see how to copy and synchronize individual or groups of files including how the Copy Web Site tool provides status indicators of differences between files. As part of this process see how the tool provides options on a file-by-file basis for decision making when there are differences in status between two or more files.
