# The DataPager Control

by [Joe Stagner](https://github.com/JoeStagner)

Generally the DataPager control is used with the ListView control. The ListView control is data driven. First create a ListView control and provide it some data. Next drop the DataPager control onto the page to enhance the web page functionally. If you have not watched the ListView control How-Do-I video it would be best to review it before using the DataPager control.
