## Overview

This tutorial series is intended for someone familiar with programming concepts, but new to ASP.NET Web Forms. If you're already familiar with ASP.NET Web Forms, this series can still help you learn about new ASP.NET 4.5 features. For readers unfamiliar with programming concepts and ASP.NET Web Forms, see the additional Web Forms tutorials provided in the [Getting Started](../../../index.md) section on the ASP.NET Web site.

The ASP.NET 4.5 provided in this tutorial series includes the following features:

- A simple UI for creating projects that offers [support for many ASP.NET frameworks](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/creating-web-projects-in-visual-studio.md#add) (Web Forms, MVC, and Web API).
- [Bootstrap](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/creating-web-projects-in-visual-studio.md#bootstrap), a layout, theming, and responsive design framework.
- [ASP.NET Identity](../../../../identity/index.md), a new ASP.NET membership system that works the same in all ASP.NET frameworks and works with web hosting software other than IIS.
- [Entity Framework 6](https://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ef.aspx)

  An update to the Entity Framework enabling you to:
  - Retrieve and manipulate data as strongly-typed objects
  - Access data asynchronously
  - Handle transient connection faults
  - Log SQL statements

For a complete ASP.NET 4.5 feature list, see [ASP.NET and Web Tools for Visual Studio 2013 Release Notes](../../../../visual-studio/overview/2013/release-notes.md).

### The Wingtip Toys sample application

The following screenshots are from the ASP.NET Web Forms application that you create in this tutorial series. When you run the application in Visual Studio, the following web Home page appears.

![Wingtip Toys - Default page](introduction-and-overview/_static/image1.png)

You can register as a new user, or sign in as an existing user. The top navigation has links to product categories and their products from the database.

If you select **Products**, all available products are displayed. 

![Wingtip Toys - Products](introduction-and-overview/_static/image2.png)

If you select a specific product, product details are displayed.

As a user, you can register and sign in with Web Forms template default functionality. This tutorial also explains how to sign in using an existing Gmail account. Additionally, you can sign in as the administrator to add and remove products from the database.

Once you've signed in as a user, you can add products to the shopping cart and checkout with PayPal. The sample application is designed to work in PayPal's developer sandbox. No actual money transaction takes place.

PayPal confirms your account, order, and payment information.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following software is installed on your computer:

- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

The .NET Framework is installed automatically.

This tutorial series uses Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. You can use either that or Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 to complete this tutorial series.

Note the following about Visual Studio:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 are referred to as *Visual Studio* throughout this tutorial series.

* Visual Studio 2017 is installed next to any older versions already installed. Sites created in earlier versions can be opened in Visual Studio 2017 and continue to open in previous versions.

* The first time you started Visual Studio, it is assumed you selected the *Web Development* settings. For more information, see [How to: Select Web Development Environment Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff521558.aspx).

After installing the prerequisites, you're ready to begin creating the Web project presented in this tutorial series.

## Download the sample application

 You can download the completed sample application at anytime from the MSDN Samples site:

[Getting Started with ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms and Visual Studio 2013 - Wingtip Toys](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=389434&clcid=0x409) (C#) 

 This download has the following items:

- The sample application in the *WingtipToys* folder.
- The resources used to create the sample application in the *WingtipToys-Assets* folder in the *WingtipToys* folder.

The download is a *.zip* file. To see the completed project that this tutorial series creates, find and select the *C#* folder in the .zip file. Save the C# folder to the folder you use to work with Visual Studio projects. By default, the Visual Studio 2017 projects folder is:

<strong>C:\Users&#92;</strong><strong><em>&lt;username&gt;</em></strong><strong>\source\repos</strong>

Rename the ***C#*** folder to ***WingtipToys***.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a folder named *WingtipToys* in your Projects folder, temporarily rename that existing folder before renaming the *C#* folder to *WingtipToys*.

To run the completed project, open the *WingtipToys* folder and double-click the *WingtipToys.sln* file. Visual Studio 2017 opens the project. Next, right-click the *Default.aspx* file in **Solution Explorer** and select **View In Browser**.

## Take a ASP.NET Web Forms quiz to review content

After completing the tutorial series, take a quiz to test your knowledge and reinforce key concepts. Each question provides an explanation and links to additional guidance.
