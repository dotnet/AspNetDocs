## Overview

The Slider control in the AJAX Control Toolkit provides a graphical slider that can be controlled using the mouse. It is possible to make the slider autopostback once its value changes.

## Steps

In order to make the slider automatically postback upon a change, both text boxes need the attribute `AutoPostBack="true"`: The text box that will become the slider itself, and the text box that holds the slider's position. Here is the required markup for that:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-the-slider-control-with-auto-postback-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The `SliderExtender` control from the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit assigns the slider functionality to the two text boxes:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-the-slider-control-with-auto-postback-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

An additional label element will later be used to inform the user of a postback:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-the-slider-control-with-auto-postback-vb/samples/sample3.aspx)]

Finally, the `ScriptManager` control of ASP.NET AJAX loads the required JavaScript for the Control Toolkit to work:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-the-slider-control-with-auto-postback-vb/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Now the slider is posting back; on the server-side, this event may be caught and acted upon:
