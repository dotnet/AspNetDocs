## Overview

The Slider control in the AJAX Control Toolkit provides a graphical slider that can be controlled using the mouse. It is possible to bind the current position of the slider to another ASP.NET control.

## Steps

In order to activate the functionality of ASP.NET AJAX and the Control Toolkit, the `ScriptManager` control must be put anywhere on the page (but within the `<form>` element):

[!code-aspx[Main](databinding-the-slider-control-cs/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Next, add two `TextBox` controls to the page. One will be transformed into a graphical slider, and the other one will hold the position of the slider.

The next step is already the final step. The `SliderExtender` control from the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit makes a slider out of the first text box and automatically updates the second text box when the slider position changes. In order for that to work, The `SliderExtender`'s `TargetControlID` attribute must be set to the ID of the first text box; the `BoundControlID` attribute must be set to the ID of the second text box.

[!code-aspx[Main](databinding-the-slider-control-cs/samples/sample3.aspx)]

As you can see in the browser, the data binding works in both directions: entering a new value in the text box updates the slider's position. If you make the second text box read only, you may add a weak protection to the text field so that it is harder for the user to manually update the value in there.
