## Overview

The `HoverMenu` control in the AJAX Control Toolkit provides a simple popup effect: When the mouse pointer hovers over an element, a popup appears at a specified position. It is also possible to use this control within a repeater.

## Steps

First of all, a data source is required. This sample uses the AdventureWorks database and the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition. The database is an optional part of a Visual Studio installation (including express edition) and is also available as a separate download under [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=64064](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=64064). The AdventureWorks database is part of the SQL Server 2005 Samples and Sample Databases (download at [https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e719ecf7-9f46-4312-af89-6ad8702e4e6e&amp;DisplayLang=en](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e719ecf7-9f46-4312-af89-6ad8702e4e6e&amp;DisplayLang=en)). The easiest way to set the database up is to use the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express ([https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c243a5ae-4bd1-4e3d-94b8-5a0f62bf7796&amp;DisplayLang=en](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c243a5ae-4bd1-4e3d-94b8-5a0f62bf7796&amp;DisplayLang=en)) and attach the `AdventureWorks.mdf` database file.

For this sample, we assume that the instance of the SQL Server 2005 Express Edition is called `SQLEXPRESS` and resides on the same machine as the web server; this is also the default setup. If your setup differs, you have to adapt the connection information for the database.

In order to activate the functionality of ASP.NET AJAX and the Control Toolkit, the `ScriptManager` control must be put anywhere on the page (but within the `<form>` element):

[!code-aspx[Main](using-hovermenu-with-a-repeater-control-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Then, add a data source to the page. In order to use a limited amount of data, we only select the first five entries in the Vendor table of the AdventureWorks database. If you are using the Visual Studio assistant to create the data source, mind that a bug in the current version does not prefix the table name (`Vendor`) with `Purchasing`. The following markup shows the correct syntax:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-hovermenu-with-a-repeater-control-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

Next, add a panel which serves as the modal popup:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-hovermenu-with-a-repeater-control-vb/samples/sample3.aspx)]

Now, the `HoverMenuExtender` comes into play. So that every element in the data source gets its own popup, the extender must be put within the repeater's `<ItemTemplate>` section. Here is the markup:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-hovermenu-with-a-repeater-control-vb/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Now every item in the data source displays a popup to the right (`PopupPosition` attribute) after a delay of 50 milliseconds (`PopDelay` attribute).
