## Overview

The CollapsiblePanel control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit extends a panel and provides it with the capability to collapse its contents and expand it again. These two actions can also be triggered from custom JavaScript code.

## Steps

First of all, create a new ASP.NET page and include the `ScriptManager` within the one `<form>` element. This loads the ASP.NET AJAX library which is required by the Control Toolkit:

[!code-aspx[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Then, create a panel with some text so that the collapse/expand effect can be seen:

[!code-aspx[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample2.aspx)]

As you can see, the panel references a CSS class which is shown here (and basically defines a background color and the panel's width):

[!code-css[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample3.css)]

The `CollapsiblePanelExtender` control requires the `TargetControlID` attribute so that the toolkit knows which panel to collapse or expand upon request:

[!code-aspx[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Unfortunately, the extender currently does not expose a specific API for collapsing or expanding the panel, but some undocumented methods will do. First of all, add three HTML buttons to the page which will then trigger the client-side JavaScript to collapse or expand the panel's contents:

[!code-aspx[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample5.aspx)]

In the client-side JavaScript code (started with `<script type="text/javascript">`), the `$find()` method needs to be used to access the `CollapsiblePanelExtender`. `$find("cpe")` will return a reference to it. From there on, specific methods will solve the task at hand.

The method for opening (expanding) the panel is called `_doOpen()`; the following code implements the `doOpen()` function called when the first button is clicked:

[!code-javascript[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample6.js)]

For closing, or collapsing the panel, the `_doClose()` method needs to be executed. So when the user clicks on the second button, the following JavaScript code is called:

[!code-javascript[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample7.js)]

The third button toggles the state of the panel: from collapsed to expanded, and vice versa. The `CollapsiblePanelExtender` exposes the `toggle()` method which does exactly that: reverses the state of the panel. However there is also another approach (which is internally used by the `toggle()` method): The `get_Collapsed()` method of the `CollapsiblePanelExtender()` tells us whether the panel is collapsed or not. Depending on the return value of this function, the panel is then either expanded (`_doOpen()` method) or collapsed (`_doClose()`) method:

[!code-javascript[Main](collapsing-and-expanding-a-panel-from-javascript-cs/samples/sample8.js)]
