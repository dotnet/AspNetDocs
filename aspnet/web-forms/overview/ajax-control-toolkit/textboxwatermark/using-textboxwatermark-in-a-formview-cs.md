## Overview

The `TextBoxWatermark` control in the AJAX Control Toolkit extends a text box so that a text is displayed within the box. When a user clicks into the box, it is emptied. If the user leaves the box without entering text, the prefilled text reappears. This is also possible within a `FormView` control.

## Steps

First of all, a data source is required. This sample uses the AdventureWorks database and the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition. The database is an optional part of a Visual Studio installation (including express edition) and is also available as a separate download under [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=64064](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=64064). The AdventureWorks database is part of the SQL Server 2005 Samples and Sample Databases (download at [https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e719ecf7-9f46-4312-af89-6ad8702e4e6e&amp;DisplayLang=en](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e719ecf7-9f46-4312-af89-6ad8702e4e6e&amp;DisplayLang=en)). The easiest way to set the database up is to use the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express ([https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c243a5ae-4bd1-4e3d-94b8-5a0f62bf7796&amp;DisplayLang=en](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c243a5ae-4bd1-4e3d-94b8-5a0f62bf7796&amp;DisplayLang=en)) and attach the `AdventureWorks.mdf` database file.

For this sample, we assume that the instance of the SQL Server 2005 Express Edition is called `SQLEXPRESS` and resides on the same machine as the web server; this is also the default setup. If your setup differs, you have to adapt the connection information for the database.

In order to activate the functionality of ASP.NET AJAX and the Control Toolkit, the `ScriptManager` control must be put anywhere on the page (but within the `<form>` element):

[!code-aspx[Main](using-textboxwatermark-in-a-formview-cs/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Then, add a data source to the page which supports the `DELETE`, `INSERT` and `UPDATE` SQL statements. If you are using the Visual Studio assistant to create the data source, mind that a bug in the current version does not prefix the table name (`Vendor`) with `Purchasing`. The following markup shows the correct syntax:

[!code-aspx[Main](using-textboxwatermark-in-a-formview-cs/samples/sample2.aspx)]

Remember the name (`ID`) of the data source, since it will be used in the `DataSourceID` property of the `FormView` control. The `<InsertItemTemplate>` section of the `FormView` contains a textbox which is extended by the `TextBoxWatermarkExtender` control. Make sure that the extender resides within the template and not outside of it.

[!code-aspx[Main](using-textboxwatermark-in-a-formview-cs/samples/sample3.aspx)]

Now when the user changes into the insert mode of the `FormView` control, the text field for the new vendor is prefilled thanks to the `TextBoxWatermarkExtender` control. A click inside the textbox lets the filler text disappear.
