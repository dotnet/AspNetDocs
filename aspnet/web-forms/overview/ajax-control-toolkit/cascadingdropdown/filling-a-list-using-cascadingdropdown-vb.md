> The CascadingDropDown control in the AJAX Control Toolkit extends a DropDownList control so that changes in one DropDownList loads associated values in another DropDownList. (For instance, one list provides a list of US states, and the next list is then filled with major cities in that state.) The first challenge to solve is to actually fill a dropdown list using this control.


## Overview

The CascadingDropDown control in the AJAX Control Toolkit extends a DropDownList control so that changes in one DropDownList loads associated values in another DropDownList. (For instance, one list provides a list of US states, and the next list is then filled with major cities in that state.) The first challenge to solve is to actually fill a dropdown list using this control.

## Steps

In order to activate the functionality of ASP.NET AJAX and the Control Toolkit, the `ScriptManager` control must be put anywhere on the page (but within the `<form>` element):

[!code-aspx[Main](filling-a-list-using-cascadingdropdown-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Then, a DropDownList control is required:

[!code-aspx[Main](filling-a-list-using-cascadingdropdown-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

For this list, a CascadingDropDown extender is added. It will send an asynchronous request to a web service which will then return a list of entries to be displayed in the list. For this to work, the following CascadingDropDown attributes need to be set:

- `ServicePath`: URL of a web service delivering the list entries
- `ServiceMethod`: Web method delivering the list entries
- `TargetControlID`: ID of the dropdown list
- `Category`: Category information that is submitted to the web method when called
- `PromptText`: Text displayed when asynchronously loading list data from the server

Here is the markup for the `CascadingDropDown` element. The only difference between C# and VB is the name of the associated web service:

[!code-aspx[Main](filling-a-list-using-cascadingdropdown-vb/samples/sample3.aspx)]

The JavaScript code coming from the `CascadingDropDown` extender calls a web service method with the following signature:

[!code-vb[Main](filling-a-list-using-cascadingdropdown-vb/samples/sample4.vb)]

So the important aspect is that the method needs to return an array of type `CascadingDropDownNameValue` (defined by the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit). In the `CascadingDropDownNameValue` constructor, first the list entry's text and then its value must be provided, just as `<option value="VALUE">NAME</option>` would do in HTML. Here is some sample data:

[!code-aspx[Main](filling-a-list-using-cascadingdropdown-vb/samples/sample5.aspx)]

Loading the page in the browser will trigger the list to be filled with three vendors.
