## Overview

The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. Whether an animation is run or not can also depend on a condition in form of some JavaScript code.

## Steps

First of all, include the `ScriptManager` in the page; then, the ASP.NET AJAX library is loaded, making it possible to use the Control Toolkit:

[!code-aspx[Main](animation-depending-on-a-condition-cs/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The animation will be applied to a panel of text which looks like this:

[!code-aspx[Main](animation-depending-on-a-condition-cs/samples/sample2.aspx)]

In the associated CSS class for the panel, define a nice background color and also set a fixed width for the panel:

[!code-css[Main](animation-depending-on-a-condition-cs/samples/sample3.css)]

Then, add the `AnimationExtender` to the page, providing an `ID`, the `TargetControlID` attribute and the obligatory `runat="server":`

[!code-aspx[Main](animation-depending-on-a-condition-cs/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Within the `<Animations>` node, use `<OnLoad>` to run the animations once the page has been fully loaded. Instead of one of the regular animations, the `<Condition>` element comes into play. The JavaScript code provided as the value of the `ConditionScript` attribute is executed at runtime. If it evaluates to true, the animation is executed, otherwise not. The following markup provides two animations, each of them being executed in 50% of cases upon random. Since there may only be one animation within `<OnLoad>`, the two `<Condition>` animations are joined together using the `<Sequence>` element:

[!code-aspx[Main](animation-depending-on-a-condition-cs/samples/sample5.aspx)]

Note that the less than sign (`<`) in the `ConditionScript` attribute must be escaped (). When you run this script, either no animation runs, or one of the two does, or both do.
