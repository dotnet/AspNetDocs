## Overview

The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. It allows to run several animations one after the other.

## Steps

First of all, include the `ScriptManager` in the page; then, the ASP.NET AJAX library is loaded, making it possible to use the Control Toolkit:

[!code-aspx[Main](executing-several-animations-after-each-other-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The animation will be applied to a panel of text which looks like this:

[!code-aspx[Main](executing-several-animations-after-each-other-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

In the associated CSS class for the panel, define a nice background color and also set a fixed width for the panel:

[!code-css[Main](executing-several-animations-after-each-other-vb/samples/sample3.css)]

Then, add the `AnimationExtender` to the page, providing an `ID`, the `TargetControlID` attribute and the obligatory `runat="server":`

[!code-aspx[Main](executing-several-animations-after-each-other-vb/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Within the `<Animations>` node, use `<OnLoad>` to run the animations once the page has been fully loaded. Generally, `<OnLoad>` only accepts one animation. The Animation framework allows you to join several animations into one using the `<Sequence>` element. All animations within `<Sequence>` are executed one after the other. Here is the a possible markup for the `AnimationExtender` control, first making the panel wider and then decreasing its height:

[!code-aspx[Main](executing-several-animations-after-each-other-vb/samples/sample5.aspx)]

When you run this script, the panel first gets wider and then smaller.
