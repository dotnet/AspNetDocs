## Overview

The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. The animations may also be changed on the server-side

## Steps

First of all, include the `ScriptManager` in the page; then, the ASP.NET AJAX library is loaded, making it possible to use the Control Toolkit:

[!code-aspx[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The animation will be applied to a panel of text which looks like this:

[!code-aspx[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

In the associated CSS class for the panel, define a nice background color and also set a fixed width for the panel:

[!code-css[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample3.css)]

The rest of the code runs on the server-side and does not use markup; instead, it uses code to create the `AnimationExtender` control:

[!code-aspx[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample4.aspx)]

However, the Control Toolkit currently does not provide an API access to create the individual animations. It is however possible to set the `AnimationExtender`'s Animations property to a string containing the XML markup used when assigning the animations declaratively. In order to create the XML which must not contain the `<Animations>` element you could use the .NET Framework's XML support or, as in the following code, just provide the string:

[!code-vb[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample5.vb)]

Finally, add the `AnimationExtender` control to the current page, within the `<form runat="server">` element, making sure that the animation is included and runs:

[!code-vb[Main](modifying-animations-from-the-server-side-vb/samples/sample6.vb)]
