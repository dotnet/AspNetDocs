## Overview

The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. The framework also allows the programmer to pick one animation out of a list of animations, depending on the evaluation of some JavaScript code.

## Steps

First of all, include the `ScriptManager` in the page; then, the ASP.NET AJAX library is loaded, making it possible to use the Control Toolkit:

[!code-aspx[Main](picking-one-animation-out-of-a-list-cs/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The animation will be applied to a panel of text which looks like this:

[!code-aspx[Main](picking-one-animation-out-of-a-list-cs/samples/sample2.aspx)]

In the associated CSS class for the panel, define a nice background color and also set a fixed width for the panel:

[!code-css[Main](picking-one-animation-out-of-a-list-cs/samples/sample3.css)]

Then, add the `AnimationExtender` to the page, providing an `ID`, the `TargetControlID` attribute and the obligatory `runat="server":`

[!code-aspx[Main](picking-one-animation-out-of-a-list-cs/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Within the `<Animations>` node, use `<OnLoad>` to run the animations once the page has been fully loaded. Instead of one of the regular animations, the `<Case>` element comes into play. The value of its SelectScript attribute is evaluated; the return value must be numerical. Depending on this number, one of the subanimations within &lt;Case&gt; is executed. For instance, if SelectScript evaluates to 2, the Control Toolkit runs the third animation within &lt;Case&gt; (counting starts at 0).

The following markup defines three subanimations: Resizing the width, resizing the height, and fading out. The JavaScript code (`Math.floor(3 * Math.random())`) then picks a number between 0 and 2, so that one of the three animations is run:
