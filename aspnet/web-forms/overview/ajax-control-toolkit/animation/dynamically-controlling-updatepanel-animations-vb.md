> The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. For the contents of an UpdatePanel, a special extender exists that relies heavily on the animation framework: UpdatePanelAnimation. It can also work together with UpdatePanel triggers.

## Overview

The Animation control in the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is not just a control but a whole framework to add animations to a control. For the contents of an `UpdatePanel`, a special extender exists that relies heavily on the animation framework: `UpdatePanelAnimation`. It can also work together with `UpdatePanel` triggers.

## Steps

The first step is as usual to include the `ScriptManager` in the page so that the ASP.NET AJAX library is loaded and the Control Toolkit can be used:

[!code-aspx[Main](dynamically-controlling-updatepanel-animations-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

The animation in this scenario will be applied to a display of the current time. This information can be written into a label using the `Page_Load()` method, or (for the sake of simplicity) the following inline code is used:

[!code-aspx[Main](dynamically-controlling-updatepanel-animations-vb/samples/sample2.aspx)]

Also, a button to trigger updating the time is created:

[!code-aspx[Main](dynamically-controlling-updatepanel-animations-vb/samples/sample3.aspx)]

This code is then put into the `<ContentTemplate>` section of an `UpdatePanel` element. The panel's `UpdateMode` attribute must be set to `"Conditional"`, since only triggers may update the panel's contents. In the `<Triggers>` section of the `UpdatePanel`, an asynchronous postback trigger is created and tied to the `Click` event of the button. Thus, if the user clicks on the button, the `UpdatePanel` is refreshed. Here is the markup for the `UpdatePanel` control:

[!code-aspx[Main](dynamically-controlling-updatepanel-animations-vb/samples/sample4.aspx)]

Finally, the `UpdatePanelAnimationExtender` must be configured: Set the `TargetControlID` attribute to the ID of the panel, and define an animation within the extender. Fading in makes sense, which creates a nice visual emphasis on the updated time. Your extender markup may then look like this:

[!code-aspx[Main](dynamically-controlling-updatepanel-animations-vb/samples/sample5.aspx)]

Run the file in the browser. Whenever you click on the button, the current time is shown in the panel, always fading in for the duration of one second.
