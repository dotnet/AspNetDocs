## Overview

The ModalPopup control in the AJAX Control Toolkit offers a simple way to create a modal popup using client-side means. Special care must be taken when a postback is created from within the popup.

## Steps

In order to activate the functionality of ASP.NET AJAX and the Control Toolkit, the `ScriptManager` control must be put anywhere on the page (but within the `<form>` element):

[!code-aspx[Main](handling-postbacks-from-a-modalpopup-vb/samples/sample1.aspx)]

Next, add a panel which serves as the modal popup. There, the user can enter a name and an email address. A button is used to close the popup and save the information. Note that the `OnClick` attribute is set so that a postback occurs when this button is clicked:

The page itself consists of two labels for exactly the same information: name and email address. A button is used to trigger the modal popup:

In order to make the popup appear, add the `ModalPopupExtender` control. Set the `PopupControlID` attribute to the panel's ID and `TargetControlID` to the button's ID:

Now whenever the `Save` button within the modal popup is clicked, the server-side `SaveData()` method is executed. There, you could save the entered data in a data store. For the sake of simplicity, the new data is just output in the label:

Also, the textbox controls within the modal popup should be filled with the current name and email. However this is only necessary when no postback occurs. If there is a postback, the ASP.NET viewstate feature will automatically fill the textboxes with the appropriate values.
