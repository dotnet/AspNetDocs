## Overview

The PopupControl extender in the AJAX Control Toolkit offers an easy way to trigger a popup when any other control is activated. When a postback occurs in such a panel and there are several panels on the page it is hard to determine which panel has been clicked.

## Steps

When using a `PopupControl` with a postback, but without having an `UpdatePanel` on the page, the Control Toolkit does not offer a way to determine which client element has triggered the popup which in turn caused the postback. However a small trick provides a workaround for this scenario.

First of all, here is the basic setup: two text boxes which both trigger the same popup, a calendar. Two `PopupControlExtenders` bring text boxes and popup together.

The basic idea is to add a hidden form field in the &lt;`form`&gt; element that holds the text box which launched the popup:

When the page is loaded, JavaScript code adds an event handler to both text boxes: Whenever the user clicks on a text box, its name is written into the hidden form field:

In the server-side code, the value of the hidden field must be read. Since hidden form fields are trivial to manipulate, a safelist approach to validate the hidden value is required. Once the correct text box has been identified, the date from the calendar is written into it.
