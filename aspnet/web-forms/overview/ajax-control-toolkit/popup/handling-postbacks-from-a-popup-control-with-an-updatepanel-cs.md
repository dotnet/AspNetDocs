## Overview

The PopupControl extender in the AJAX Control Toolkit offers an easy way to trigger a popup when any other control is activated. Special care has to be taken when a postback occurs within such a popup.

## Steps

When using a `PopupControl` with a postback, an `UpdatePanel` can prevent the page refresh caused by the postback. The following markup defines a couple of important elements:

- A `ScriptManager` control so that the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit works
- Two `TextBox` controls which will both trigger a popup
- A `Panel` control that will serve as the popup
- Within the panel, a `Calendar` control is embedded within an `UpdatePanel` control
- Two `PopupControlExtender` controls that assign the panel to the text boxes

Note that the `OnSelectionChanged` attribute of the `Calendar` control is set. So when the user selects a date within the calendar, a postback occurs and the server-side method `c1_SelectionChanged()` is executed. Within that method, the current date must be retrieved and written back to the textbox.

The syntax for that is as follows: First of all, a proxy object for the `PopupControlExtender` on the page must be generated. The ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit offers the `GetProxyForCurrentPopup()` method. The object this method returns supports the `Commit()` method which sends a value back to the control that triggered the popup (not the control that triggered the method call!). The following code provides the selected date as the argument for the `Commit()` method, causing the code to write the selected date back to the text box:

Now whenever you click on a calendar date, the selected date appears in the associated text box, creating a date picker control that can currently be found on many websites.
