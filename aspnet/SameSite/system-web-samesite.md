# Work with SameSite cookies in ASP.NET

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

[SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07) is an [IETF](https://ietf.org/about/) draft designed to provide some protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The [SameSite 2019 draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00):

* Treats cookies as `SameSite=Lax` by default.
* States cookies that explicitly assert `SameSite=None` in order to enable cross-site delivery should be marked as `Secure`.

`Lax` works for most app cookies. Some forms of authentication like [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) (OIDC) and [WS-Federation](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/ws-fed) default to POST based redirects. The POST based redirects trigger the SameSite browser protections, so SameSite is disabled for these components. Most [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) logins are not affected due to differences in how the request flows.

The `None` parameter causes compatibility problems with clients that implemented the prior 2016 draft standard (for example, iOS 12). See [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in this document.

Each ASP.NET Core component that emits cookies needs to decide if SameSite is appropriate.

## API usage with SameSite

[HttpContext.Response.Cookies.Append](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append*) defaults to `Unspecified`, meaning no SameSite attribute added to the cookie and the client will use its default behavior (Lax for new browsers, None for old ones). The following code shows how to change the cookie SameSite value to `SameSiteMode.Lax`:

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs?name=snippet)]

All ASP.NET Core components that emit cookies override the preceding defaults with settings appropriate for their scenarios. The overridden preceding default values haven't changed.

| Component | cookie | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieBuilder> | <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieBuilder.SameSite> | `Unspecified` |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.Session>  | [SessionOptions.Cookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.SessionOptions.Cookie) |`Lax` |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures.CookieTempDataProvider>  | [CookieTempDataProviderOptions.Cookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.CookieTempDataProviderOptions.Cookie) | `Lax` |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.IAntiforgery> | [AntiforgeryOptions.Cookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Antiforgery.AntiforgeryOptions.Cookie)| `Strict` |
| [Cookie Authentication](xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.CookieExtensions.AddCookie*) | [CookieAuthenticationOptions.Cookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.CookieAuthenticationOptions.CookieName) | `Lax` |
| <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.TwitterExtensions.AddTwitter*> | [TwitterOptions.StateCookie ](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter.TwitterOptions.StateCookie) | `Lax`  |
| <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationHandler`1> | [RemoteAuthenticationOptions.CorrelationCookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.CorrelationCookie)  | `None` |
| <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.OpenIdConnectExtensions.AddOpenIdConnect*> | [OpenIdConnectOptions.NonceCookie](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectOptions.NonceCookie)| `None` |
| [HttpContext.Response.Cookies.Append](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append*) | <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions> | `Unspecified` |

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.1"

ASP.NET Core 3.1 and later provides the following SameSite support:

* Redefines the behavior of `SameSiteMode.None` to emit `SameSite=None`
* Adds a new value `SameSiteMode.Unspecified` to omit the SameSite attribute.
* All cookies APIs default to `Unspecified`. Some components that use cookies set values more specific to their scenarios. See the table above for examples.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.0"

In ASP.NET Core 3.0 and later the SameSite defaults were changed to avoid conflicting with inconsistent client defaults. The following APIs have changed the default from `SameSiteMode.Lax ` to `-1` to avoid emitting a SameSite attribute for these cookies:

* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions> used with [HttpContext.Response.Cookies.Append](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.IResponseCookies.Append*)
* <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieBuilder>  used as a factory for `CookieOptions`
* [CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy)

::: moniker-end

## History and changes

SameSite support was first implemented in ASP.NET Core in 2.0 using the [2016 draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07#section-4.1). The 2016 standard was opt-in. ASP.NET Core opted-in by setting several cookies to `Lax` by default. After encountering several [issues](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/318) with authentication, most SameSite usage was [disabled](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/348).

Patches were issued in November 2019 to update from the 2016 standard to the 2019 standard. The [2019 draft of the SameSite specification](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/390):

* Is **not** backwards compatible with the 2016 draft. For more information, see [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in this document.
* Specifies cookies are treated as `SameSite=Lax` by default.
* Specifies cookies that explicitly assert `SameSite=None` in order to enable cross-site delivery should be marked as `Secure`. `None` is a new entry to opt out.
* Is supported by patches issued for ASP.NET Core 2.1, 2.2, and 3.0. ASP.NET Core 3.1 has additional SameSite support.
* Is scheduled to be enabled by [Chrome](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592) by default in [Feb 2020](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/developers-get-ready-for-new.html). Browsers started moving to this standard in 2019.

## APIs impacted by the change from the 2016 SameSite draft standard to the 2019 draft standard

* [Http.SameSiteMode](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.SameSiteMode)
* [CookieOptions.SameSite](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieOptions.SameSite)
* [CookieBuilder.SameSite](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieBuilder.SameSite)
* [CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.CookiePolicyOptions.MinimumSameSitePolicy)
* <xref:Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers.SameSiteMode?displayProperty=fullName>
* <xref:Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers.SetCookieHeaderValue.SameSite?displayProperty=fullName>

## Supporting older browsers

The 2016 SameSite standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as `SameSite=Strict` values. Apps accessed from older browsers which support the 2016 SameSite standard may break when they get a SameSite property with a value of `None`. Web apps must implement browser detection if they intend to support older browsers. ASP.NET Core doesn't implement browser detection because User-Agents values are highly volatile and change frequently. An extension point in <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.CookiePolicy> allows plugging in User-Agent specific logic.

In `Startup.Configure`, add code that calls <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.CookiePolicyAppBuilderExtensions.UseCookiePolicy*> before calling <xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.AuthAppBuilderExtensions.UseAuthentication*> or *any* method that writes cookies:

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Startup.cs?name=snippet5&highlight=18-19)]

In `Startup.ConfigureServices`, add code similar to the following:

::: moniker range="= aspnetcore-3.1"

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Startup31.cs?name=snippet)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< aspnetcore-3.1"

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Startup.cs?name=snippet)]

::: moniker-end

In the preceding sample, `MyUserAgentDetectionLib.DisallowsSameSiteNone` is a user supplied library that detects if the user agent doesn't support SameSite `None`:

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Startup31.cs?name=snippet2)]

The following code shows a sample `DisallowsSameSiteNone` method:

> [!WARNING]
> The following code is for demonstration only:
> * It should not be considered complete.
> * It is not maintained or supported.

[!code-csharp[](samesite/sample/Startup31.cs?name=snippetX)]

## Test apps for SameSite problems

Apps that interact with remote sites such as through third-party login need to:

* Test the interaction on multiple browsers.
* Apply the [CookiePolicy browser detection and mitigation](#sob) discussed in this document.

Test web apps using a client version that can opt-in to the new SameSite behavior. Chrome, Firefox, and Chromium Edge all have new opt-in feature flags that can be used for testing. After your app applies the SameSite patches, test it with older client versions, especially Safari. For more information, see [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in this document.

### Test with Chrome

Chrome 78+ gives misleading results because it has a temporary mitigation in place. The Chrome 78+ temporary mitigation allows cookies less than two minutes old. Chrome 76 or 77 with the appropriate test flags enabled provides more accurate results. To test the new SameSite behavior toggle `chrome://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies` to **Enabled**. Older versions of Chrome (75 and below) are reported to fail with the new `None` setting. See [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in this document.

Google does not make older chrome versions available. Follow the instructions at [Download Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) to test older versions of Chrome. Do **not** download Chrome from links provided by searching for older versions of chrome.

* [Chromium 76 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/664998/)
* [Chromium 74 Win64](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Win_x64/638880/)

### Test with Safari

Safari 12 strictly implemented the prior draft and fails when the new `None` value is in a cookie. `None` is avoided via the browser detection code [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in this document. Test Safari 12, Safari 13, and WebKit based OS style logins using MSAL, ADAL or whatever library you are using. The problem is dependent on the underlying OS version. OSX Mojave (10.14) and iOS 12 are known to have compatibility problems with the new SameSite behavior. Upgrading the OS to OSX Catalina (10.15) or iOS 13 fixes the problem. Safari does not currently have an opt-in flag for testing the new spec behavior.

### Test with Firefox

Firefox support for the new standard can be tested on version 68+ by opting in on the `about:config` page with the feature flag `network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault`. There haven't been reports of compatibility issues with older versions of Firefox.

### Test with Edge browser

Edge supports the old SameSite standard. Edge version 44 doesn't have any known compatibility problems with the new standard.

### Test with Edge (Chromium)

SameSite flags are set on the `edge://flags/#same-site-by-default-cookies` page. No compatibility issues were discovered with Edge Chromium.

### Test with Electron

Versions of Electron include older versions of Chromium. For example, the version of Electron used by Teams is Chromium 66, which exhibits the older behavior. You must perform your own compatibility testing with the version of Electron your product uses. See [Supporting older browsers](#sob) in the following section.
