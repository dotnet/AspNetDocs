# Enabling Windows Authentication in Katana

> This article shows how to enable Windows Authentication in Katana. It covers two scenarios: Using IIS to host Katana, and using HttpListener to self-host Katana in a custom process. Thanks to Barry Dorrans, David Matson, and Chris Ross for reviewing this article.

Katana is Microsoft's implementation of [OWIN](http://owin.org/), the Open Web Interface for .NET. You can read an introduction to OWIN and Katana [here](an-overview-of-project-katana.md). The OWIN architecture has several layers:

- Host: Manages the process in which the OWIN pipeline runs.
- Server: Opens a network socket and listens for requests.
- Middleware: Processes the HTTP request and response.

Katana currently provides two servers, both of which support Windows Integrated Authentication:

- **Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb**. Uses IIS with the ASP.NET pipeline.
- **Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener**. Uses [System.Net.HttpListener](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.httplistener.aspx). This server is currently the default option when self-hosting Katana.

> [!NOTE]
> Katana does not currently provide OWIN middleware for Windows Authentication, because this functionality is already available in the servers.

## Windows Authentication in IIS

Using Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb, you can simply enable Windows Authentication in IIS.

Let's start by creating a new ASP.NET application, using the "ASP.NET Empty Web Application" project template.

![Example illustration](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/_static/image1.png)

Next, add NuGet packages. From the **Tools** menu, select **NuGet Package Manager**, then select **Package Manager Console**. In the Package Manager Console window, enter the following command:

[!code-console[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample1.cmd)]

Now add a class named `Startup` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample2.cs)]

That's all you need to create a "Hello world" application for OWIN, running on IIS. Press F5 to debug the application. You should see "Hello World!" in the browser window.

![Illustration example](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/_static/image2.png)

Next, we'll enable Windows Authentication in IIS Express. From the **View** menu, select **Properties**. Click on the project name in Solution Explorer to view the project properties.

In the **Properties** window, set **Anonymous Authentication** to **Disabled** and set **Windows Authentication** to **Enabled**.

When you run the application from Visual Studio, IIS Express will require the user's Windows credentials. You can see this by using [Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/home) or another HTTP debugging tool. Here is an example HTTP response:

[!code-console[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample3.cmd?highlight=1,5-6)]

The WWW-Authenticate headers in this response indicate that the server supports the [Negotiate](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt) protocol, which uses either Kerberos or NTLM.

Later, when you deploy the application to a server, follow [these steps](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/authentication/windowsauthentication) to enable Windows Authentication in IIS on that server.

## Windows Authentication in HttpListener

If you are using Microsoft.Owin.Host.HttpListener to self-host Katana, you can enable Windows Authentication directly on the **HttpListener** instance.

First, create a new console application. Next, add NuGet packages. From the **Tools** menu, select **NuGet Package Manager**, then select **Package Manager Console**. In the Package Manager Console window, enter the following command:

[!code-console[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample4.cmd)]

Now add a class named `Startup` with the following code:

[!code-csharp[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample5.cs)]

This class implements the same "Hello world" example from before, but it also sets Windows Authentication as the authentication scheme.

Inside the `Main` function, start the OWIN pipeline:

[!code-csharp[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample6.cs)]

You can send a request in Fiddler to confirm that the application is using Windows Authentication:

[!code-console[Main](enabling-windows-authentication-in-katana/samples/sample7.cmd?highlight=1,4-5)]
