# OWIN and Katana

Katana is a flexible set of components for building and hosting Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN)-based web apps. New development should use [ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core). The `Microsoft.Owin.*` libraries are not available for .NET Core because ASP.NET Core has equivalent replacements for them.
