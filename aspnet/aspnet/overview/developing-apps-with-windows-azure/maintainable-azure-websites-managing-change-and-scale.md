> Microsoft Azure makes it easy to build and deploy websites to production. But you're not done when your application is live, you're just getting started! You'll need to handle changing requirements, database updates, scale, and more. Fortunately, Azure App Service has you covered, with plenty of features to help you keep your sites running smoothly.
>
> Azure offers secure and flexible development, deployment and scaling options for any size web application. Leverage your existing tools to create and deploy applications without the hassle of managing infrastructure.
>
> Provision a production web application yourself in minutes by easily deploying content created using your favorite development tool. You can deploy an existing site directly from source control with support for **Git**, **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, **TFS**, and even **DropBox**. Deploy directly from your favorite IDE or from scripts using **PowerShell** in Windows or **CLI** tools running on any OS. Once deployed, keep your sites constantly up-to-date with support for continuous deployment.
>
> Azure provides scalable, durable cloud storage, backup, and recovery solutions for any data, big or small. When deploying applications to a production environment, storage services such as Tables, Blobs and SQL Databases, help you scale your application in the cloud.
>
> With SQL Databases, it is important to keep your productive database up-to-date when deploying new versions of your application. Thanks to **Entity Framework Code First Migrations**, the development and deployment of your data model has been simplified to update your environments in minutes. This hands-on lab will show you the different topics you could encounter when deploying your web app to production environments in Microsoft Azure.

<a id="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Using Entity Framework Migrations

When you are developing an application, your data model might change over time. These changes could affect the existing model in your database (if you are creating a new version) and it is important to keep your database up-to-date to prevent errors.

To simplify the tracking of these changes in your model, **Entity Framework Code First Migrations** automatically detect changes comparing your model with the database schema and generates specific code to update your database, creating new *versions* of your database.

This exercise shows you how to enable **Migrations** for your application and how you can easily detect and generate changes to update your databases.

<a id="Ex1Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Enabling Migrations

In this task, you will go through the steps of enabling **Entity Framework Code First Migrations** to the **Geek Quiz** database, changing the model and understanding how those changes are reflected in the database.

1. Open Visual Studio and open the **GeekQuiz.sln** solution file from **Source\Ex1-UsingEntityFrameworkMigrations\Begin**.
2. Build the solution in order to download and install the **NuGet** package dependencies. To do this, right-click the solution and click **Build Solution** or press **Ctrl + Shift + B**.
3. From the **Tools** menu in Visual Studio, select **NuGet Package Manager**, and then click **Package Manager Console**.
4. In the **Package Manager Console**, enter the following command and then press **Enter**. An initial migration based on the existing model will be created.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample1.ps1)]

    ![Enabling Migrations](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image1.png "Enabling Migrations")

    *Enabling Migrations*

    > [!NOTE]
    > This command adds a **Migrations** folder to Geek Quiz project that contains a file called **Configuration.cs**. The **Configuration** class allows you to configure how Migrations behaves for your context.
5. With Migrations enabled, you need to update the **Configuration** class to populate the database with the initial data that **Geek Quiz** requires. Under **Migrations**, replace the **Configuration.cs** file with the one located in the **Source\Assets** folder of this lab.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since **Migrations** will call the **Seed** method with every database update, you need to be sure that records are not duplicated in the database. The **AddOrUpdate** method will help to prevent duplicate data.
6. To add an initial migration, enter the following command and then press **Enter**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that there is no database named &quot;GeekQuizProd&quot; in your LocalDB instance.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample2.ps1)]

    ![Adding base schema migration](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image2.png "Adding base schema migration")

    *Adding base schema migration*

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Add-Migration** will scaffold the next migration based on changes you have made to your model since the last migration was created. In this case, as it is the first migration of the project, it will add the scripts to create all the tables defined in the **TriviaContext** class.
7. Execute the migration to update the database by running the following command. For this command you will specify the **Verbose** flag to view the SQL statements being applied to the target database.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample3.ps1)]

    ![Creating initial database](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image3.png "Creating initial database")

    *Creating initial database*

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Update-Database** will apply any pending migrations to the database. In this case, it will create the database using the connection string defined in your web.config file.
8. Go to **View** menu and open **SQL Server Object Explorer**.

    ![Open in SQL Server Object Explorer](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image4.png "Open in SQL Server Object Explorer")

    *Open in SQL Server Object Explorer*
9. In the **SQL Server Object Explorer** window, connect to your LocalDB instance by right-clicking the **SQL Server** node and selecting **Add SQL Server...** option.

    ![Adding a SQL Server Instance](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image5.png "Adding a SQL Server Instance")

    *Adding a SQL Server instance to SQL Server Object Explorer*
10. Set the **server name** to *(localdb)\v11.0* and leave **Windows Authentication** as your authentication mode. Click **Connect** to continue.

    ![Connecting to LocalDB](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image6.png "Connecting to LocalDB")

    *Connecting to LocalDB*
11. Open the **GeekQuizProd** database and expand the **Tables** node. As you can see, the **Update-Database** command generated all the tables defined in the **TriviaContext** class. Locate the **dbo.TriviaQuestions** table and open the columns node. In the next task, you will add a new column to this table and update the database using **Migrations**.

    ![Trivia Questions Columns](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image7.png "Trivia Questions Columns")

    *Trivia Questions Columns*

<a id="Ex1Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 â€“ Updating Database Schema Using Migrations

In this task, you will use **Entity Framework Code First Migrations** to detect a change in your model and generate the necessary code to update the database. You will update the **TriviaQuestions** entity by adding a new property to it. Then you will run commands to create a new Migration to include the new column in the table.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, double-click the **TriviaQuestion.cs** file located inside the **Models** folder.
2. Add a new property named **Hint**, as shown in the following code snippet.

    [!code-csharp[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample4.cs)]
3. In the **Package Manager Console**, enter the following command and then press **Enter**. A new migration will be created reflecting the change in our model.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample5.ps1)]

    ![Add-Migration](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image8.png "Add-Migration")

    *Add-Migration*

    > [!NOTE]
    > A Migration file is composed of two methods, **Up** and **Down**.
    >
    > - The **Up** method will be used to specify what changes the current version of our application need to apply to the database.
    > - The **Down** is used to reverse the changes we have added to the **Up** method.
    >
    > When the Database Migration updates the database, it will run all migrations in the timestamp order, and only those that have not been used since the last update (The \_MigrationHistory table keeps track of which migrations have been applied). The **Up** method of all migrations will be called and will make the changes we have specified to the database. If we decide to go back to a previous migration, the **Down** method will be called to redo the changes in a reverse order.
4. In the **Package Manager Console**, enter the following command and then press **Enter**.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample6.ps1)]
5. The output of the **Update-Database** command generated an **Alter Table** SQL statement to add a new column to the **TriviaQuestions** table, as shown in the image below.

    ![Add column SQL statement generated](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image9.png "Add column SQL statement generated")

    *Add column SQL statement generated*
6. In **SQL Server Object Explorer**, refresh the **dbo.TriviaQuestions** table and check that the new **Hint** column is displayed.

    ![Showing the new Hint Column](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image10.png "Showing the new Hint Column")

    *Showing the new Hint Column*
7. Back in the **TriviaQuestion.cs** editor, add a **StringLength** constraint to the *Hint* property, as shown in the following code snippet.

    [!code-csharp[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample7.cs)]
8. In the **Package Manager Console**, enter the following command and then press **Enter**.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample8.ps1)]
9. In the **Package Manager Console**, enter the following command and then press **Enter**.

    [!code-powershell[Main](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/samples/sample9.ps1)]
10. The output of the **Update-Database** command generated an **Alter Table** SQL statement to update the *hint* column type of the **TriviaQuestions** table, as shown in the image below.

    ![Alter column SQL statement generated](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image11.png "Alter column SQL statement generated")

    *Alter column SQL statement generated*
11. In **SQL Server Object Explorer**, refresh the **dbo.TriviaQuestions** table and check that the **Hint** column type is **nvarchar(150)**.

    ![Showing the new constraint](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image12.png "Showing the new constraint")

    *Showing the new constraint*

### Exercise 2: Deploying a Web App to Staging

**Web Apps in Azure App Service** enables you to perform staged publishing. Staged publishing creates a staging site slot for each default production site and enables you to swap these slots with no down time. This is really useful to validate changes before releasing to the public, incrementally integrate site content, and roll back if changes are not working as expected.

In this exercise, you will deploy the **Geek Quiz** application to the staging environment of your web app using Git source control. To do this, you will create the web app and provision the required components at the management portal, configure a **Git** repository and push the application source code from your local computer to the staging slot. You will also update your production database with the **Code First Migrations** you created in the previous exercise. You will then execute the application in this test environment to verify its operation. Once you are satisfied that it is working according to your expectations, you will promote the application to production.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable staged publishing, the web app must be in **Standard mode**. Note that additional charges will be incurred if you change your web app to Standard mode. For more information about pricing, see [App Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

<a id="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Creating a Web App in Azure App Service

#### Task 4 â€“ Promoting the Web App to Production

Now that you have verified that the web app is working correctly in the staging environment, you are ready to promote it to production. In this task, you will swap the staging site slot with the production site slot.

1. Go back to the management portal and select the staging site slot. Click **Swap** in the command bar.

    ![Swap to production](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image44.png)

    *Swap to production*
2. Click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog box to proceed with the swap operation. Azure will immediately swap the content of the production site with the content of the staging site.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some settings from the staged version will automatically be copied to the production version (e.g. connection string overrides, handler mappings, etc.) but other settings will not change (e.g. DNS endpoints, SSL bindings, etc.).

    *Confirming swap operation*
3. Once the swap is complete, select the production slot and click **Browse** in the command bar to open the production site. Notice the URL in the address bar.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might need to refresh your browser to clear cache. In Internet Explorer, you can do this by pressing **CTRL+R**.

    ![Web app running in the production environment](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image46.png)
4. In the **GitBash** console, update the remote URL for the local Git repository to target the production slot. To do this, run the following command replacing the placeholders with your deployment username and the name of your web app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the following exercises, you will push changes to the production site instead of staging just for the simplicity of the lab. In a real-world scenario, it is recommended to verify the changes in the staging environment before promoting to production.

<a id="Exercise3"></a>
### Exercise 3: Performing Deployment Rollback in Production

There are scenarios where you do not have a staging slot to perform hot swap between staging and production, for example, if you are working with **Free** or **Shared** mode. In those scenarios, you should test your application in a testing environment â€“either locally or in a remote siteâ€“ before deploying to production. However, it is possible that an issue not detected during the testing phase may arise in the production site. In this case, it is important to have a mechanism to easily switch to a previous and more stable version of the application as quickly as possible.

In **Azure App Service**, continuous deployment from source control makes this possible thanks to the **redeploy** action available in the management portal. Azure keeps track of the deployments associated with the commits pushed to the repository and provides an option to redeploy your application using any of your previous deployments, at any time.

In this exercise you will perform a change to the code in the **Geek Quiz** application that intentionally injects a *bug*. You will deploy the application to production to see the error, and then you will take advantage of the redeploy feature to go back to the previous state.

#### Task 1 â€“ Updating the Geek Quiz Application

In this task, you will refactor a small piece of code of the **TriviaController** class to extract part of the logic that retrieves the selected quiz option from the database into a new method.

1. Switch to the Visual Studio instance with the **GeekQuiz** solution from the previous exercise.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, open the **TriviaController.cs** file inside the **Controllers** folder.
3. Locate the **StoreAsync** method and select the code highlighted in the following figure.

7. Press **CTRL + S** to save the changes.

<a id="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 â€“ Redeploying the Geek Quiz Application

You will now push the changes you made in the previous task to the repository, which will trigger a new deployment to the production environment. Then, you will troubleshot an issue using the **F12 development tools** provided by Internet Explorer, and then perform a rollback to the previous deployment from the Azure management portal.

1. Open a new **Git Bash** console to deploy the updated application to Azure App Service.
2. Execute the following commands to push the changes to Azure. Update the *[YOUR-APPLICATION-PATH]* placeholder with the path to the **GeekQuiz** solution. You will be prompted for your deployment password.

    > [!NOTE]
    > URL rewriting is the process of intercepting an incoming Web request and redirecting the request to a different resource. The URL rewriting rules tells the rewriting engine when a request needs to be redirected, and where should they be redirected. A rewriting rule is composed of two strings: the pattern to look for in the requested URL (usually, using regular expressions), and the string to replace the pattern with, if found. For more information, see [URL Rewriting in ASP.NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms972974.aspx).
3. Press **CTRL + S** to save the changes.

### Exercise 5: Using Autoscale for Web Apps

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise is optional, since it requires support for Web Load &amp; Performance Testing which is only available for **Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Edition**. For more information on specific Visual Studio 2013 features, compare versions [here](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/compare).

**Azure App Service Web Apps** provides the Autoscale feature for web apps running in **Standard Mode**. Autoscale lets Azure automatically scale the instance count of your web app depending on the load. When Autoscale is enabled, Azure checks the CPU of your web app once every five minutes and adds instances as needed at that point in time. If the CPU usage is low, Azure will remove instances once every two hours to ensure that the performance of your web app is not degraded.

In this exercise you will go through the steps required to configure the **Autoscale** feature for the **Geek Quiz** web app. You will verify this feature by running a Visual Studio load test to generate enough CPU load on the application to trigger an instance upgrade.

<a id="Ex5Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Configuring Autoscale Based on the CPU Metric

In this task you will use the Azure management portal to enable the Autoscale feature for the web app you created in Exercise 2.

1. In the [Azure management portal](/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-overview), select **Websites** and click the web app you created in Exercise 2.
2. Navigate to the **Scale** page. Under the **capacity** section, select **CPU** for the **Scale by Metric** configuration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When scaling by CPU, Azure dynamically adjusts the number of instances that the app uses if the CPU usage changes.

    ![Selecting to scale by CPU](maintainable-azure-websites-managing-change-and-scale/_static/image77.png "Selecting the CPU metric for auto scaling")

    *Selecting to scale by CPU*
3. Change the **Target CPU** configuration to **20**-**40** percent.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This range represents the average CPU usage for your web app. Azure will add or remove instances to keep your web app in this range. The minimum and maximum number of instances used for scaling is specified in the **Instance Count** configuration. Azure will never go above or beyond that limit.
    >
    > The default **Target CPU** values are modified just for the purposes of this lab. By configuring the CPU range with small values, you are increasing the chances to trigger Autoscale when a moderate load is placed on the application.

## Summary

In this hands-on lab, you learned how to set up and deploy your application to production web apps in Azure. You started by detecting and updating your databases using **Entity Framework Code First Migrations**, then continued by deploying new versions of your site using **Git** and performing rollbacks to the latest stable version of your site. Additionally, you learned how to scale your app using Storage to move your static content to a Blob container.
