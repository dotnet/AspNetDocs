# How Do I: Return JSON Formatted Data for an AJAX Call in an ASP.NET MVC Web Application?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to use the JsonResult and Json classes to return instances of classes as JSON formatted data. First, a sample MVC web application is created and a controller and associated view are added for customer information. Then a simple customer class is created as part of the data model. A GetCustomer() function is then added to the customer controller to retrieve data for a single customer in JSON format. Finally, script is added to the customer view that uses jQuery to make an AJAX call to GetCustomer() to retrieve the customer data in JSON format
