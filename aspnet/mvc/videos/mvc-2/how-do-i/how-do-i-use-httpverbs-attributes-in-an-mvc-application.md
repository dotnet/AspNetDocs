# How Do I: Use HttpVerbs Attributes in an MVC Application?

by [Chris Pels](https://twitter.com/chrispels)

In this video Chris Pels shows how to use the HttpVerbs attributes to control access to MVC actions. First, a sample application is created with a default controller and view for editing the information. Next, a second Index action is added to the controller which has an HttpPost attribute which restricts it to being called only when an HTTP POST is used. As a follow-up, the AcceptVerbs() attribute is implemented as an alternative syntax for Visual Studio 2008. A use of the HttpVerbs for preventing the security risk associated with using an HTTP GET to perform a delete from a link is then discussed.
