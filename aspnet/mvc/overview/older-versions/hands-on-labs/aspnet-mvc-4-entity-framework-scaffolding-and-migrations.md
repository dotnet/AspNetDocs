# ASP.NET MVC 4 Entity Framework Scaffolding and Migrations

By [Web Camps Team](https://twitter.com/webcamps)

[Download Web Camps Training Kit](https://aka.ms/webcamps-training-kit)

If you are familiar with ASP.NET MVC 4 controller methods, or have completed the &quot;Helpers, Forms and Validation&quot; Hands-On lab, you should be aware that much of the logic to create, update, list and remove any data entity is repeated throughout the application. Not to mention that, if your model has several classes to manipulate, you will be likely to spend a considerable time writing the POST and GET action methods for each entity operation, as well as each of the views.

In this lab you will learn how to use the ASP.NET MVC 4 scaffolding to automatically generate the baseline of your application's CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Starting from a simple model class, and, without writing a single line of code, you will create a controller that will contain all the CRUD operations, as well as the all the necessary views. After building and running the simple solution, you will have the application database generated, together with the MVC logic and views for data manipulation.

In addition, you will learn how easy it is to use Entity Framework Migrations to perform model updates throughout your entire application. Entity Framework Migrations will let you modify your database after the model has changed with simple steps. With all these in mind, you will be able to build and maintain web applications more efficiently, taking advantage of the latest features of ASP.NET MVC 4.

> [!NOTE]
> All sample code and snippets are included in the Web Camps Training Kit, available from at [Microsoft-Web/WebCampTrainingKit Releases](https://aka.ms/webcamps-training-kit). The project specific to this lab is available at [ASP.NET MVC 4 Entity Framework Scaffolding and Migrations](https://github.com/Microsoft-Web/HOL-EntityFrameworkScaffoldingAndMigrations).

<a id="Task_3-_Updating_the_database_using_Entity_Framework_Migrations"></a>
#### Task 3- Updating the database using Entity Framework Migrations

In this task you will update the database using Entity Framework Migrations. You will discover how easy it is to change the model and reflect the changes in your databases by using the Entity Framework Migrations feature.

1. Open the Package Manager Console. Select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
2. In the Package Manager Console, enter the following command:

    PMC

    [!code-powershell[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample2.ps1)]

    ![Enabling Migrations](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image11.png "Enabling Migrations")

    *Enabling migrations*

    The Enable-Migration command creates the **Migrations** folder, which contains a script to initialize the database.

    ![Migrations folder](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image12.png "Migrations folder")

    *Migrations folder*
3. Open the **Configuration.cs** file in the Migrations folder. Locate the class constructor and change the **AutomaticMigrationsEnabled** value to *true*.

    [!code-csharp[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample3.cs)]
4. Open the Person class and add an attribute for the person's middle name. With this new attribute, you are changing the model.

    [!code-csharp[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample4.cs)]
5. Select **Build | Build Solution** on the menu to build the application.

    ![Building the application](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image13.png "Building the application")

    *Building the application*
6. In the Package Manager Console, enter the following command:

    PMC

    [!code-powershell[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample5.ps1)]

    This command will look for changes in the data objects, and then, it will add the necessary commands to modify the database accordingly.

    ![Adding a middle name](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image14.png "Adding a middle name")

    *Adding a middle name*
7. (Optional) You can run the following command to generate a SQL script with the differential update. This will let you update the database manually (In this case it's not necessary), or apply the changes in other databases:

    PMC

    [!code-powershell[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample6.ps1)]

    ![Generating a SQL script](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image15.png "Generating a SQL script")

    *Generating a SQL script*

    ![SQL Script update](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image16.png "SQL Script update")

    *SQL Script update*
8. In the Package Manager Console, enter the following command to update the database:

    PMC

    [!code-powershell[Main](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/samples/sample7.ps1)]

    ![Updating the Database](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image17.png "Updating the Database")

    *Updating the Database*

    This will add the **MiddleName** column in the **People** table to match the current definition of the **Person** class.
9. Once the database is updated, right-click the Controller folder and select **Add | Controller** to add the Person controller again (Complete with the same values). This will update the existing methods and views adding the new attribute.

    ![Adding a controller update](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image18.png "Adding a controller update")

    *Updating the controller*
10. Click **Add**. Then, select the values **Overwrite PersonController.cs** and the **Overwrite associated views** and click **OK**.

   ![Adding a controller overwrite](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image19.png)

   *Updating the controller*

<a id="Ex1Task4"></a>

<a id="Task4-_Running_the_application"></a>
#### Task4- Running the application

1. Press **F5** to run the application.
2. Open **/Person**. Notice that the data was preserved, while the middle name column was added.

    ![Middle Name added](aspnet-mvc-4-entity-framework-scaffolding-and-migrations/_static/image20.png "Middle Name added")

    *Middle Name added*
3. If you click **Edit**, you will be able to add a middle name to the current person.
