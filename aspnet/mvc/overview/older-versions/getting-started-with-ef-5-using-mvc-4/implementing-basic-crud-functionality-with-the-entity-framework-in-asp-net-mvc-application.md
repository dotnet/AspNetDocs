> The Contoso University sample web application demonstrates how to create ASP.NET MVC 4 applications using the Entity Framework 5 Code First and Visual Studio 2012. For information about the tutorial series, see [the first tutorial in the series](creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md). You can start the tutorial series from the beginning or [download a starter project for this chapter](building-the-ef5-mvc4-chapter-downloads.md) and start here.

> > If you run into a problem you can't resolve, [download the completed chapter](building-the-ef5-mvc4-chapter-downloads.md) and try to reproduce your problem. You can generally find the solution to the problem by comparing your code to the completed code. For some common errors and how to solve them, see [Errors and Workarounds.](advanced-entity-framework-scenarios-for-an-mvc-web-application.md#errors)


In the previous tutorial you created an MVC application that stores and displays data using the Entity Framework and SQL Server LocalDB. In this tutorial you'll review and customize the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) code that the MVC scaffolding automatically creates for you in controllers and views.

> [!NOTE]
> It's a common practice to implement the repository pattern in order to create an abstraction layer between your controller and the data access layer. To keep these tutorials simple, you won't implement a repository until a later tutorial in this series.


In this tutorial, you'll create the following web pages:

![Student_Details_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image1.png)

![Student_Edit_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image2.png)

![Student_Create_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image3.png)

![Student_delete_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image4.png)

## Creating a Details Page

The scaffolded code for the Students `Index` page left out the `Enrollments` property, because that property holds a collection. In the `Details` page you'll display the contents of the collection in an HTML table.

 In *Controllers\StudentController.cs*, the action method for the `Details` view uses the `Find` method to retrieve a single `Student` entity. 

[!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample1.cs)]

 The key value is passed to the method as the `id` parameter and comes from route data in the **Details** hyperlink on the Index page. 

1. Open *Views\Student\Details.cshtml*. Each field is displayed using a `DisplayFor` helper, as shown in the following example: 

    [!code-cshtml[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample2.cshtml)]
2. After the `EnrollmentDate` field and immediately before the closing `fieldset` tag, add code to display a list of enrollments, as shown in the following example:

    [!code-cshtml[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample3.cshtml?highlight=4-22)]

    This code loops through the entities in the `Enrollments` navigation property. For each `Enrollment` entity in the property, it displays the course title and the grade. The course title is retrieved from the `Course` entity that's stored in the `Course` navigation property of the `Enrollments` entity. All of this data is retrieved from the database automatically when it's needed. (In other words, you are using lazy loading here. You did not specify *eager loading* for the `Courses` navigation property, so the first time you try to access that property, a query is sent to the database to retrieve the data. You can read more about lazy loading and eager loading in the [Reading Related Data](reading-related-data-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md) tutorial later in this series.)
3. Run the page by selecting the **Students** tab and clicking a **Details** link for Alexander Carson. You see the list of courses and grades for the selected student:

    ![Student_Details_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image5.png)

## Updating the Create Page

1. In *Controllers\StudentController.cs*, replace the `HttpPost``Create` action method with the following code to add a `try-catch` block and the [Bind attribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.bindattribute(v=vs.108).aspx) to the scaffolded method: 

    [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample4.cs?highlight=4,7-8,14-20)]

    This code adds the `Student` entity created by the ASP.NET MVC model binder to the `Students` entity set and then saves the changes to the database. (*Model binder* refers to the ASP.NET MVC functionality that makes it easier for you to work with data submitted by a form; a model binder converts posted form values to CLR types and passes them to the action method in parameters. In this case, the model binder instantiates a `Student` entity for you using property values from the `Form` collection.)

    The `ValidateAntiForgeryToken` attribute helps prevent [cross-site request forgery](../../security/xsrfcsrf-prevention-in-aspnet-mvc-and-web-pages.md) attacks.

<a id="overpost"></a>

    > [!WARNING]
    > Security - The `Bind` attribute is added to protect against *over-posting*. For example, suppose the `Student` entity includes a `Secret` property that you don't want this web page to update.
    > 
    > [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample5.cs?highlight=7)]
    > 
    > Even if you don't have a `Secret` field on the web page, a hacker could use a tool such as [fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/home), or write some JavaScript, to post a `Secret` form value. Without the [Bind](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.bindattribute(v=vs.108).aspx) attribute limiting the fields that the model binder uses when it creates a `Student` instance*,* the model binder would pick up that `Secret` form value and use it to update the `Student` entity instance. Then whatever value the hacker specified for the `Secret` form field would be updated in your database. The following image shows the fiddler tool adding the `Secret` field (with the value "OverPost") to the posted form values.
    > 
    > ![](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image6.png)  
    > 
    > The value "OverPost" would then be successfully added to the `Secret` property of the inserted row, although you never intended that the web page be able to update that property.
    > 
    > It's a security best practice to use the `Include` parameter with the `Bind` attribute to *whitelist* fields. It's also possible to use the `Exclude` parameter to *blacklist* fields you want to exclude. The reason `Include` is more secure is that when you add a new property to the entity, the new field is not automatically protected by an `Exclude` list.
    > 
    > Another alternative approach, and one preferred by many, is to use only view models with model binding. The view model contains only the properties you want to bind. Once the MVC model binder has finished, you copy the view model properties to the entity instance.

    Other than the `Bind` attribute, the `try-catch` block is the only change you've made to the scaffolded code. If an exception that derives from [DataException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.dataexception.aspx) is caught while the changes are being saved, a generic error message is displayed. [DataException](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.dataexception.aspx) exceptions are sometimes caused by something external to the application rather than a programming error, so the user is advised to try again. Although not implemented in this sample, a production quality application would log the exception (and non-null inner exceptions ) with a logging mechanism such as [ELMAH](https://code.google.com/p/elmah/).

    The code in *Views\Student\Create.cshtml* is similar to what you saw in *Details.cshtml*, except that `EditorFor` and `ValidationMessageFor` helpers are used for each field instead of `DisplayFor`. The following example shows the relevant code:

    [!code-cshtml[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample6.cshtml)]

    *Create.cshtml* also includes `@Html.AntiForgeryToken()`, which works with the `ValidateAntiForgeryToken` attribute in the controller to help prevent [cross-site request forgery](../../security/xsrfcsrf-prevention-in-aspnet-mvc-and-web-pages.md) attacks.

    No changes are required in *Create.cshtml*.
2. Run the page by selecting the **Students** tab and clicking **Create New**.

    ![Student_Create_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image7.png)

    Some data validation works by default. Enter names and an invalid date and click **Create** to see the error message.

    ![Students_Create_page_error_message](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image8.png)

    The following highlighted code shows the model validation check.

    [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample7.cs?highlight=5)]

    Change the date to a valid value such as 9/1/2005 and click **Create** to see the new student appear in the **Index** page.

    ![Students_Index_page_with_new_student](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image9.png)

## Updating the Edit POST Page

In *Controllers\StudentController.cs*, the `HttpGet` `Edit` method (the one without the `HttpPost` attribute) uses the `Find` method to retrieve the selected `Student` entity, as you saw in the `Details` method. You don't need to change this method.

However, replace the `HttpPost` `Edit` action method with the following code to add a `try-catch` block and the [Bind attribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.bindattribute(v=vs.108).aspx):

[!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample8.cs)]

This code is similar to what you saw in the `HttpPost` `Create` method. However, instead of adding the entity created by the model binder to the entity set, this code sets a flag on the entity indicating it has been changed. When the [SaveChanges](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext.savechanges(v=VS.103).aspx) method is called, the [Modified](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entitystate.aspx) flag causes the Entity Framework to create SQL statements to update the database row. All columns of the database row will be updated, including those that the user didn't change, and concurrency conflicts are ignored. (You'll learn how to handle concurrency in a later tutorial in this series.)

### Entity States and the Attach and SaveChanges Methods

The database context keeps track of whether entities in memory are in sync with their corresponding rows in the database, and this information determines what happens when you call the `SaveChanges` method. For example, when you pass a new entity to the [Add](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbset.add(v=vs.103).aspx) method, that entity's state is set to `Added`. Then when you call the [SaveChanges](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext.savechanges(v=VS.103).aspx) method, the database context issues a SQL `INSERT` command.

An entity may be in one of the[following states](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entitystate.aspx):

- `Added`. The entity does not yet exist in the database. The `SaveChanges` method must issue an `INSERT` statement.
- `Unchanged`. Nothing needs to be done with this entity by the `SaveChanges` method. When you read an entity from the database, the entity starts out with this status.
- `Modified`. Some or all of the entity's property values have been modified. The `SaveChanges` method must issue an `UPDATE` statement.
- `Deleted`. The entity has been marked for deletion. The `SaveChanges` method must issue a `DELETE` statement.
- `Detached`. The entity isn't being tracked by the database context.

In a desktop application, state changes are typically set automatically. In a desktop type of application, you read an entity and make changes to some of its property values. This causes its entity state to automatically be changed to `Modified`. Then when you call `SaveChanges`, the Entity Framework generates a SQL `UPDATE` statement that updates only the actual properties that you changed.

The disconnected nature of web apps doesn't allow for this continuous sequence. The [DbContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext(v=VS.103).aspx) that reads an entity is disposed after a page is rendered. When the `HttpPost` `Edit` action method is called, a new request is made and you have a new instance of the [DbContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbcontext(v=VS.103).aspx), so you have to manually set the entity state to `Modified.` Then when you call `SaveChanges`, the Entity Framework updates all columns of the database row, because the context has no way to know which properties you changed.

If you want the SQL `Update` statement to update only the fields that the user actually changed, you can save the original values in some way (such as hidden fields) so that they are available when the `HttpPost` `Edit` method is called. Then you can create a `Student` entity using the original values, call the `Attach` method with that original version of the entity, update the entity's values to the new values, and then call `SaveChanges.` For more information, see [Entity states and SaveChanges](https://msdn.microsoft.com/data/jj592676) and [Local Data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/data/jj592872) in the MSDN Data Developer Center.

The code in *Views\Student\Edit.cshtml* is similar to what you saw in *Create.cshtml*, and no changes are required.

Run the page by selecting the **Students** tab and then clicking an **Edit** hyperlink.

![Student_Edit_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image10.png)

Change some of the data and click **Save**. You see the changed data in the Index page.

![Students_Index_page_after_edit](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image11.png)

## Updating the Delete Page

In *Controllers\StudentController.cs*, the template code for the `HttpGet` `Delete` method uses the `Find` method to retrieve the selected `Student` entity, as you saw in the `Details` and `Edit` methods. However, to implement a custom error message when the call to `SaveChanges` fails, you'll add some functionality to this method and its corresponding view.

As you saw for update and create operations, delete operations require two action methods. The method that is called in response to a GET request displays a view that gives the user a chance to approve or cancel the delete operation. If the user approves it, a POST request is created. When that happens, the `HttpPost` `Delete` method is called and then that method actually performs the delete operation.

You'll add a `try-catch` block to the `HttpPost` `Delete` method to handle any errors that might occur when the database is updated. If an error occurs, the `HttpPost` `Delete` method calls the `HttpGet` `Delete` method, passing it a parameter that indicates that an error has occurred. The `HttpGet Delete` method then redisplays the confirmation page along with the error message, giving the user an opportunity to cancel or try again.

1. Replace the `HttpGet` `Delete` action method with the following code, which manages error reporting: 

    [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample9.cs)]

    This code accepts an [optional](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd264739.aspx) Boolean parameter that indicates whether it was called after a failure to save changes. This parameter is `false` when the `HttpGet` `Delete` method is called without a previous failure. When it is called by the `HttpPost` `Delete` method in response to a database update error, the parameter is `true` and an error message is passed to the view.
2. Replace the `HttpPost` `Delete` action method (named `DeleteConfirmed`) with the following code, which performs the actual delete operation and catches any database update errors.

     [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample10.cs)]

     This code retrieves the selected entity, then calls the [Remove](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.data.entity.dbset.remove(v=vs.103).aspx) method to set the entity's status to `Deleted`. When `SaveChanges` is called, a SQL `DELETE` command is generated. You have also changed the action method name from `DeleteConfirmed` to `Delete`. The scaffolded code named the `HttpPost` `Delete` method `DeleteConfirmed` to give the `HttpPost` method a unique signature. ( The CLR requires overloaded methods to have different method parameters.) Now that the signatures are unique, you can stick with the MVC convention and use the same name for the `HttpPost` and `HttpGet` delete methods.

     If improving performance in a high-volume application is a priority, you could avoid an unnecessary SQL query to retrieve the row by replacing the lines of code that call the `Find` and `Remove` methods with the following code as shown in yellow highlight:

     [!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample11.cs)]

     This code instantiates a `Student` entity using only the primary key value and then sets the entity state to `Deleted`. That's all that the Entity Framework needs in order to delete the entity.

     As noted, the `HttpGet` `Delete` method doesn't delete the data. Performing a delete operation in response to a GET request (or for that matter, performing any edit operation, create operation, or any other operation that changes data) creates a security risk. For more information, see [ASP.NET MVC Tip #46 — Don't use Delete Links because they create Security Holes](http://stephenwalther.com/blog/archive/2009/01/21/asp.net-mvc-tip-46-ndash-donrsquot-use-delete-links-because.aspx) on Stephen Walther's blog.
3. In *Views\Student\Delete.cshtml*, add an error message between the `h2` heading and the `h3` heading, as shown in the following example:

     [!code-cshtml[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample12.cshtml?highlight=2)]

     Run the page by selecting the **Students** tab and clicking a **Delete** hyperlink:

     ![Student_Delete_page](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/_static/image12.png)
4. Click **Delete**. The Index page is displayed without the deleted student. (You'll see an example of the error handling code in action in the [Handling Concurrency](../../getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/handling-concurrency-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md) tutorial later in this series.)

## Ensuring that Database Connections Are Not Left Open

To make sure that database connections are properly closed and the resources they hold freed up, you should see to it that the context instance is disposed. That is why the scaffolded code provides a [Dispose](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.idisposable.dispose(v=vs.110).aspx) method at the end of the `StudentController` class in *StudentController.cs*, as shown in the following example:

[!code-csharp[Main](implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application/samples/sample13.cs)]

The base `Controller` class already implements the `IDisposable` interface, so this code simply adds an override to the `Dispose(bool)` method to explicitly dispose the context instance.

## Summary

You now have a complete set of pages that perform simple CRUD operations for `Student` entities. You used MVC helpers to generate UI elements for data fields. For more information about MVC helpers, see [Rendering a Form Using HTML Helpers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd410596(v=VS.98).aspx) (the page is for MVC 3 but is still relevant for MVC 4).

In the next tutorial you'll expand the functionality of the Index page by adding sorting and paging.
