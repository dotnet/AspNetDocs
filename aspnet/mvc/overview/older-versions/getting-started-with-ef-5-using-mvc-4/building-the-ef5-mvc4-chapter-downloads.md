    > [!NOTE]
    > If you get the following error:  
    >   
    >  *The term 'Update-Database' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.*  
    > Exit and restart Visual Studio.

    Each migration will run, then the seed method will run. You can now run the app.
