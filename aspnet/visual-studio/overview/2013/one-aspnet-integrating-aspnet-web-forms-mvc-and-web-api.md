# Hands On Lab: One ASP.NET: Integrating ASP.NET Web Forms, MVC and Web API

by [Web Camps Team](https://twitter.com/webcamps)

[Download Web Camps Training Kit](https://aka.ms/webcamps-training-kit)

> ASP.NET is a framework for building Web sites, apps and services using specialized technologies such as MVC, Web API and others. With the expansion ASP.NET has seen since its creation and the expressed need to have these technologies integrated, there have been recent efforts in working towards **One ASP.NET**.
> 
> Visual Studio 2013 introduces a new unified project system which lets you build an application and use all the ASP.NET technologies in one project. This feature eliminates the need to pick one technology at the start of a project and stick with it, and instead encourages the use of multiple ASP.NET frameworks within one project.
> 
> All sample code and snippets are included in the Web Camps Training Kit, available at [https://aka.ms/webcamps-training-kit](https://aka.ms/webcamps-training-kit).

<a id="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Creating a New Web Forms Project

In this exercise you will create a new Web Forms site in Visual Studio 2013 using the **One ASP.NET** unified project experience, which will allow you to easily integrate Web Forms, MVC and Web API components in the same application. You will then explore the generated solution and identify its parts, and finally you will see the Web site in action.

<a id="Ex1Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Creating a New Site Using the One ASP.NET Experience

In this task you will start creating a new Web site in Visual Studio based on the **One ASP.NET** project type. **One ASP.NET** unifies all ASP.NET technologies and gives you the option to mix and match them as desired. You will then recognize the different components of Web Forms, MVC and Web API that live side by side within your application.

1. Open **Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web** and select **File | New Project...** to start a new solution.

    ![Creating a New Project](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image1.png)

    *Creating a New Project*
2. In the **New Project** dialog box, select **ASP.NET Web Application** under the **Visual C# | Web** tab, and make sure **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected. Name the project *MyHybridSite*, choose a **Location** and click **OK**.

    ![New ASP.NET Web Application project](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image2.png)

    *Creating a new ASP.NET Web Application project*
3. In the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog box, select the **Web Forms** template and select the **MVC** and **Web API** options. Also, make sure that the **Authentication** option is set to **Individual User Accounts**. Click **OK** to continue.

    ![Creating a new project with the Web Forms template, including Web API and MVC components](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image3.png)

    *Creating a new project with the Web Forms template, including Web API and MVC components*
4. You can now explore the structure of the generated solution.

    ![Exploring the generated solution](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image4.png)

    *Exploring the generated solution*

    1. **Account:** This folder contains the Web Form pages to register, log in to and manage the application's user accounts. This folder is added when the **Individual User Accounts** authentication option is selected during the configuration of the Web Forms project template.
    2. **Models:** This folder will contain the classes that represent your application data.
    3. **Controllers** and **Views**: These folders are required for the **ASP.NET MVC** and **ASP.NET Web API** components. You will explore the MVC and Web API technologies in the next exercises.
    4. The **Default.aspx**, **Contact.aspx** and **About.aspx** files are pre-defined Web Form pages that you can use as starting points to build the pages specific to your application. The programming logic of those files resides in a separate file referred to as the &quot;code-behind&quot; file, which has an &quot;.aspx.vb&quot; or &quot;.aspx.cs&quot; extension (depending on the language used). The code-behind logic runs on the server and dynamically produces the HTML output for your page.
    5. The **Site.Master** and **Site.Mobile.Master** pages define the look and feel and the standard behavior of all the pages in the application.
5. Double-click the **Default.aspx** file to explore the content of the page.

    ![Exploring the Default.aspx page](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image5.png)

    *Exploring the Default.aspx page*

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Page** directive at the top of the file defines the attributes of the Web Forms page. For example, the **MasterPageFile** attribute specifies the path to the master page -in this case, the *Site.Master* page- and the **Inherits** attribute defines the code-behind class for the page to inherit. This class is located in the file determined by the **CodeBehind** attribute.
    > 
    > The **asp:Content** control holds the actual content of the page (text, markup and controls) and is mapped to a **asp:ContentPlaceHolder** control on the master page. In this case, the page content will be rendered inside the *MainContent* control defined in the *Site.Master* page.
6. Expand the **App\_Start** folder and notice the **WebApiConfig.cs** file. Visual Studio included that file in the generated solution because you included Web API when configuring your project with the One ASP.NET template.
7. Open the **WebApiConfig.cs** file. In the *WebApiConfig* class you will find the configuration associated with Web API, which maps HTTP routes to **Web API controllers**.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample1.cs)]
8. Open the **RouteConfig.cs** file. Inside the *RegisterRoutes* method you will find the configuration associated with MVC, which maps HTTP routes to **MVC controllers**.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample2.cs)]

<a id="Ex1Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 â€“ Running the Solution

In this task you will run the generated solution, explore the app and some of its features, like URL rewriting and built-in authentication.

1. To run the solution, press **F5** or click the **Start** button located on the toolbar. The application home page should open in the browser.

    ![Running the solution](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image6.png)
2. Verify that the Web Forms pages are being invoked. To do this, append **/contact.aspx** to the URL in the address bar and press **Enter**.

    ![Friendly URLs](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image7.png)

    *Friendly URLs*

    > [!NOTE]
    > As you can see, the URL changes to **/contact**. Starting from **ASP.NET 4**, URL routing capabilities were added to Web Forms, so you can write URLs like *`http://www.mysite.com/products/software`* instead of *`http://www.mysite.com/products.aspx?category=software`*. For more information refer to [URL Routing](../../../web-forms/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-aspnet-45-web-forms/url-routing.md).
3. You will now explore the authentication flow integrated into the application. To do this, click **Register** in the upper-right corner of the page.

    ![Registering a new user](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image8.png)

    *Registering a new user*
4. In the **Register** page, enter a **User name** and **Password**, and then click **Register**.

    ![Register page](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image9.png)

    *Register page*
5. The application registers the new account, and the user is authenticated.

    ![User authenticated](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image10.png)

    *User authenticated*
6. Go back to Visual Studio and press **SHIFT + F5** to stop debugging.

<a id="Exercise2"></a>
### Exercise 2: Creating an MVC Controller Using Scaffolding

In this exercise you will take advantage of the ASP.NET Scaffolding framework provided by Visual Studio to create an ASP.NET MVC 5 controller with actions and Razor views to perform CRUD operations, without writing a single line of code. The scaffolding process will use Entity Framework Code First to generate the data context and the database schema in the SQL database.

**About Entity Framework Code First**

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables you to create data access applications by programming with a conceptual application model instead of programming directly using a relational storage schema.

The Entity Framework Code First modeling workflow allows you to use your own domain classes to represent the model that EF relies on when performing querying, change-tracking and updating functions. Using the Code First development workflow, you do not need to begin your application by creating a database or specifying a schema. Instead, you can write standard .NET classes that define the most appropriate domain model objects for your application, and Entity Framework will create the database for you.

> [!NOTE]
> You can learn more about Entity Framework [here](../../../entity-framework.md).

<a id="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Creating a New Model

You will now define a **Person** class, which will be the model used by the scaffolding process to create the MVC controller and the views. You will start by creating a **Person** model class, and the CRUD operations in the controller will be automatically created using scaffolding features.

1. Open **Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web** and the **MyHybridSite.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex2-MvcScaffolding/Begin** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Models** folder of the **MyHybridSite** project and select **Add | Class...**.

    ![Adding the Person model class](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image11.png)

    *Adding the Person model class*
3. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, name the file *Person.cs* and click **Add**.

    ![Creating the Person model class](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image12.png)

    *Creating the Person model class*
4. Replace the content of the **Person.cs** file with the following code. Press **CTRL + S** to save the changes.

    (Code Snippet - *BringingTogetherOneAspNet - Ex2 - PersonClass*)

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample3.cs)]
5. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyHybridSite** project and select **Build**, or press **CTRL + SHIFT + B** to build the project.

<a id="Ex2Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 â€“ Creating an MVC Controller

Now that the **Person** model is created, you will use ASP.NET MVC scaffolding with Entity Framework to create the CRUD controller actions and views for **Person**.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder of the **MyHybridSite** project and select **Add | New Scaffolded Item...**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create an MVC Controller by selecting New Scaffolded Item in Solution Explorer.](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image13.png)

    *Creating a new Scaffolded Controller*
2. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select **MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework** and then click **Add.**

    ![Selecting MVC 5 Controller with views and Entity Framework](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image14.png)

    *Selecting MVC 5 Controller with views and Entity Framework*
3. Set *MvcPersonController* as the **Controller name**, select the **Use async controller actions** option and select **Person (MyHybridSite.Models)** as the **Model class**.

    ![Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image15.png)

    *Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding*
4. Under **Data context class**, click **New data context...**.

    ![Creating a new data context](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image16.png)

    *Creating a new data context*
5. In the **New Data Context** dialog box, name the new data context *PersonContext* and click **Add**.

    ![Creating the new PersonContext](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image17.png)

    *Creating the new PersonContext type*
6. Click **Add** to create the new controller for **Person** with scaffolding. Visual Studio will then generate the controller actions, the Person data context and the Razor views.

    ![After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image18.png)

    *After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding*
7. Open the **MvcPersonController.cs** file in the **Controllers** folder. Notice that the CRUD action methods have been generated automatically.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample4.cs)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > By selecting the **Use async controller actions** check box from the scaffolding options in the previous steps, Visual Studio generates asynchronous action methods for all actions that involve access to the Person data context. It is recommended that you use asynchronous action methods for long-running, non-CPU bound requests to avoid blocking the Web server from performing work while the request is being processed.

<a id="Ex2Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 â€“ Running the Solution

In this task, you will run the solution again to verify that the views for **Person** are working as expected. You will add a new person to verify that it is successfully saved to the database.

1. Press **F5** to run the solution.
2. Navigate to **/MvcPerson**. The scaffolded view that shows the list of people should appear.
3. Click **Create New** to add a new person.

    ![Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image19.png)

    *Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views*
4. In the **Create** view, provide a **Name** and an **Age** for the person, and click **Create**.

    ![Adding a new person](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image20.png)

    *Adding a new person*
5. The new person is added to the list. In the element list, click **Details** to display the person's details view. Then, in the **Details** view, click **Back to List** to go back to the list view.

    ![Person's details view](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image21.png)

    *Person's details view*
6. Click the **Delete** link to delete the person. In the **Delete** view, click **Delete** to confirm the operation.

    ![Deleting a person](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image22.png)

    *Deleting a person*
7. Go back to Visual Studio and press **SHIFT + F5** to stop debugging.

<a id="Exercise3"></a>
### Exercise 3: Creating a Web API Controller Using Scaffolding

The Web API framework is part of the ASP.NET Stack and designed to make implementing HTTP services easier, generally sending and receiving JSON- or XML-formatted data through a RESTful API.

In this exercise, you will use ASP.NET Scaffolding again to generate a Web API controller. You will use the same **Person** and **PersonContext** classes from the previous exercise to provide the same person data in JSON format. You will see how you can expose the same resources in different ways within the same ASP.NET application.

<a id="Ex3Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 â€“ Creating a Web API Controller

In this task you will create a new **Web API Controller** that will expose the person data in a machine-consumable format like JSON.

1. If not already opened, open **Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web** and open the **MyHybridSite.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex3-WebAPI/Begin** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you start with the Begin solution from Exercise 3, press **CTRL + SHIFT + B** to build the solution.
2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder of the **MyHybridSite** project and select **Add | New Scaffolded Item...**.

    ![Screenshot showing how to create a Web API Controller by selecting New Scaffolded Item in Solution Explorer.](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image23.png)

    *Creating a new scaffolded Controller*
3. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select **Web API** in the left pane, then **Web API 2 Controller with actions, using Entity Framework** in the middle pane and then click **Add.**

    ![Selecting Web API 2 Controller with actions and Entity Framework](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image24.png "Selecting Web API 2 Controller with actions and Entity Framework")

    *Selecting Web API 2 Controller with actions and Entity Framework*
4. Set *ApiPersonController* as the **Controller name**, select the **Use async controller actions** option and select **Person (MyHybridSite.Models)** and **PersonContext (MyHybridSite.Models)** as the **Model** and **Data context** classes respectively. Then click **Add**.

    ![Adding a Web API Controller with scaffolding](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image25.png "Adding a Web API controller with scaffolding")

    *Adding a Web API controller with scaffolding*
5. Visual Studio will then generate the **ApiPersonController** class with the four CRUD actions to work with your data.

    ![After creating the Web API controller with scaffolding](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image26.png "After creating the Web API controller with scaffolding")

    *After creating the Web API controller with scaffolding*
6. Open the **ApiPersonController.cs** file and inspect the *GetPeople* action method. This method queries the db field of **PersonContext** type in order to get the people data.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample5.cs)]
7. Now notice the comment above the method definition. It provides the URI that exposes this action which you will use in the next task.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample6.cs)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, Web API is configured to catch the queries to the */api* path to avoid collisions with MVC controllers. If you need to change this setting, refer to [Routing in ASP.NET Web API](../../../web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions/routing-in-aspnet-web-api.md).

<a id="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 â€“ Running the Solution

In this task you will use the Internet Explorer **F12 developer tools** to inspect the full response from the Web API controller. You will see how you can capture network traffic to get more insight into your application data.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that **Internet Explorer** is selected in the **Start** button located on the Visual Studio toolbar.
> 
> ![Internet Explorer option](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image27.png)
> 
> The **F12 developer tools** have a wide set of functionality that is not covered in this hands-on-lab. If you want to learn more about it, refer to [Using the F12 developer tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/bg182326(v=vs.85)).

1. Press **F5** to run the solution.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In order to follow this task correctly, your application needs to have data. If your database is empty, you can go back to Task 3 in Exercise 2 and follow the steps on how to create a new person using the MVC views.
2. In the browser, press **F12** to open the **Developer Tools** panel. Press **CTRL** + **4** or click the **Network** icon, and then click the green arrow button to begin capturing network traffic.

    ![Initiating Web API network capture](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image28.png "Initiating Web API network capture")

    *Initiating Web API network capture*
3. Append **api/ApiPerson** to the URL in the browser's address bar. You will now inspect the details of the response from the **ApiPersonController**.

    ![Retrieving person data through Web API](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image29.png "Retrieving person data through Web API")

    *Retrieving person data through Web API*

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once the download finishes, you will be prompted to make an action with the downloaded file. Leave the dialog box open in order to be able to watch the response content through the Developers Tool window.
4. Now you will inspect the body of the response. To do this, click the **Details** tab and then click **Response body**. You can check that the downloaded data is a list of objects with the properties **Id**, **Name** and **Age** that correspond to the **Person** class.

    ![Viewing Web API Response Body](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image30.png "Viewing Web API Response Body")

    *Viewing Web API Response Body*

<a id="Ex3Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 â€“ Adding Web API Help Pages

When you create a Web API, it is useful to create a help page so that other developers will know how to call your API. You could create and update the documentation pages manually, but it is better to auto-generate them to avoid having to do maintenance work. In this task you will use a Nuget package to automatically generate Web API help pages to the solution.

1. From the **Tools** menu in Visual Studio, select **NuGet Package Manager**, and then click **Package Manager Console**.
2. In the **Package Manager Console** window, execute the following command:

    [!code-powershell[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample7.ps1)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.HelpPage** package installs the necessary assemblies and adds MVC Views for the help pages under the **Areas/HelpPage** folder.

    ![HelpPage Area](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image31.png "HelpPage Area")

    *HelpPage Area*
3. By default, the help pages have placeholder strings for documentation. You can use XML documentation comments to create the documentation. To enable this feature, open the **HelpPageConfig.cs** file located in the **Areas/HelpPage/App\_Start** folder and uncomment the following line:

    [!code-javascript[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample8.js)]
4. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project **MyHybridSite**, select **Properties** and click the **Build** tab.

    ![Build tab](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image32.png "Build section")

    *Build tab*
5. Under **Output**, select **XML documentation file**. In the edit box, type **App\_Data/XmlDocument.xml**.

    ![Output section in Build tab](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image33.png "Output section in build tab")

    *Output section in Build tab*
6. Press **CTRL** + **S** to save the changes.
7. Open the **ApiPersonController.cs** file from the **Controllers** folder.
8. Enter a new line between the *GetPeople* method signature and the *// GET api/ApiPerson* comment, and then type three forward slashes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Visual Studio automatically inserts the XML elements which define the method documentation.
9. Add a summary text and the return value for the *GetPeople* method. It should look like the following.

    [!code-csharp[Main](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/samples/sample9.cs)]
10. Press **F5** to run the solution.
11. Append **/help** to the URL in the address bar to browse to the help page.

    ![ASP.NET Web API Help Page](one-aspnet-integrating-aspnet-web-forms-mvc-and-web-api/_static/image34.png "ASP.NET Web API Help Page")

    *ASP.NET Web API Help Page*

    > [!NOTE]
    > The main content of the page is a table of APIs, grouped by controller. The table entries are generated dynamically, using the **IApiExplorer** interface. If you add or update an API controller, the table will be automatically updated the next time you build the application.
    > 
    > The **API** column lists the HTTP method and relative URI. The **Description** column contains information that has been extracted from the method's documentation.
12. Note that the description you added above the method definition is displayed in the description column.
