ASP.NET Web Pages lets you create custom displays for rendering content on mobile or other devices.

The simplest way to create device-specific page in an ASP.NET Web Pages site is by using a file-naming pattern like this: *FileName.Mobile.cshtml*. You can create two versions of a page (for example, one named *MyFile.cshtml* and one named *MyFile.Mobile.cshtml*). At run time, when a mobile device requests *MyFile.cshtml*, ASP.NET renders the content from *MyFile.Mobile.cshtml*. Otherwise, *MyFile.cshtml* is rendered.

The following example shows how to enable mobile rendering by adding a content page for mobile devices. *Page1.cshtml* contains content plus a navigation sidebar. *Page1.Mobile.cshtml* contains the same content, but omits the sidebar.

1. In an ASP.NET Web Pages site, create a file named *Page1.cshtml* and replace the current content with following markup.

    [!code-html[Main](rendering-aspnet-web-pages-sites-for-mobile-devices/samples/sample1.html)]
2. Create a file named *Page1.Mobile.cshtml* and replace the existing content with the following markup. Notice that the mobile version of the page omits the navigation section for better rendering on a smaller screen.

    [!code-html[Main](rendering-aspnet-web-pages-sites-for-mobile-devices/samples/sample2.html)]
3. Run a desktop browser and browse to *Page1.cshtml*. ![mobilesites-1](rendering-aspnet-web-pages-sites-for-mobile-devices/_static/image1.png)
4. Run a mobile browser (or a mobile device emulator) and browse to *Page1.cshtml*. (Notice that you do not include *.mobile.* as part of the URL.) Even though the request is to *Page1.cshtml*, ASP.NET renders *Page1.Mobile.cshtml*.

> [!NOTE]
> To test mobile pages, you can use a mobile device simulator that runs on a desktop computer. This tool lets you test web pages as they would look on mobile devices (that is, typically with a much smaller display area). One example of a simulator is the [User Agent Switcher add-on](http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/) for Mozilla Firefox, which lets you emulate various mobile browsers from a desktop version of Firefox.
