## What is Dependency Injection?

A *dependency* is any object that another object requires. For example, it's common to define a [repository](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html) that handles data access. Let's illustrate with an example. First, we'll define a domain model:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample1.cs)]

Here is a simple repository class that stores items in a database, using Entity Framework.

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample2.cs)]

Now let's define a Web API controller that supports GET requests for `Product` entities. (I'm leaving out POST and other methods for simplicity.) Here is a first attempt:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample3.cs)]

Notice that the controller class depends on `ProductRepository`, and we are letting the controller create the `ProductRepository` instance. However, it's a bad idea to hard code the dependency in this way, for several reasons.

- If you want to replace `ProductRepository` with a different implementation, you also need to modify the controller class.
- If the `ProductRepository` has dependencies, you must configure these inside the controller. For a large project with multiple controllers, your configuration code becomes scattered across your project.
- It is hard to unit test, because the controller is hard-coded to query the database. For a unit test, you should use a mock or stub repository, which is not possible with the current design.

We can address these problems by *injecting* the repository into the controller. First, refactor the `ProductRepository` class into an interface:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample4.cs)]

Then provide the `IProductRepository` as a constructor parameter:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample5.cs)]

This example uses [constructor injection](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#FormsOfDependencyInjection). You can also use *setter injection*, where you set the dependency through a setter method or property.

But now there is a problem, because your application doesn't create the controller directly. Web API creates the controller when it routes the request, and Web API doesn't know anything about `IProductRepository`. This is where the Web API dependency resolver comes in.

## The Web API Dependency Resolver

Web API defines the **IDependencyResolver** interface for resolving dependencies. Here is the definition of the interface:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample6.cs)]

The **IDependencyScope** interface has two methods:

- **GetService** creates one instance of a type.
- **GetServices** creates a collection of objects of a specified type.

The **IDependencyResolver** method inherits **IDependencyScope** and adds the **BeginScope** method. I'll talk about scopes later in this tutorial.

When Web API creates a controller instance, it first calls **IDependencyResolver.GetService**, passing in the controller type. You can use this extensibility hook to create the controller, resolving any dependencies. If **GetService** returns null, Web API looks for a parameterless constructor on the controller class.

## Dependency Resolution with the Unity Container

Although you could write a complete **IDependencyResolver** implementation from scratch, the interface is really designed to act as bridge between Web API and existing IoC containers.

An IoC container is a software component that is responsible for managing dependencies. You register types with the container, and then use the container to create objects. The container automatically figures out the dependency relations. Many IoC containers also allow you to control things like object lifetime and scope.

> [!NOTE]
> "IoC" stands for "inversion of control", which is a general pattern where a framework calls into application code. An IoC container constructs your objects for you, which "inverts" the usual flow of control.

For this tutorial, we'll use [Unity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff647202.aspx) from Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices. (Other popular libraries include [Castle Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/), [Spring.Net](http://www.springframework.net/), [Autofac](https://code.google.com/p/autofac/), [Ninject](http://www.ninject.org/), and [StructureMap](http://structuremap.github.io/documentation/).) You can use NuGet Package Manager to install Unity. From the **Tools** menu in Visual Studio, select **NuGet Package Manager**, then select **Package Manager Console**. In the Package Manager Console window, type the following command:

[!code-console[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample7.cmd)]

Here is an implementation of **IDependencyResolver** that wraps a Unity container.

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample8.cs)]

## Configuring the Dependency Resolver

Set the dependency resolver on the **DependencyResolver** property of the global **HttpConfiguration** object.

The following code registers the `IProductRepository` interface with Unity and then creates a `UnityResolver`.

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample9.cs)]

## Dependency Scope and Controller Lifetime

Controllers are created per request. To manage object lifetimes, **IDependencyResolver** uses the concept of a *scope*.

The dependency resolver attached to the **HttpConfiguration** object has global scope. When Web API creates a controller, it calls **BeginScope**. This method returns an **IDependencyScope** that represents a child scope.

Web API then calls **GetService** on the child scope to create the controller. When request is complete, Web API calls **Dispose** on the child scope. Use the **Dispose** method to dispose of the controller's dependencies.

How you implement **BeginScope** depends on the IoC container. For Unity, scope corresponds to a child container:

[!code-csharp[Main](dependency-injection/samples/sample10.cs)]

Most IoC containers have similar equivalents.
