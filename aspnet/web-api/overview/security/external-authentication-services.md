# External Authentication Services with ASP.NET Web API (C#)

Visual Studio 2017 and ASP.NET 4.7.2 expand the security options for [Single Page Applications](../../../single-page-application/index.md) (SPA) and [Web API](../../index.md) services to integrate with external authentication services, which include several OAuth/OpenID and social media authentication services: Microsoft Accounts, Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

### Prerequisites

To follow the examples in this walkthrough, you need to have the following:

- Visual Studio 2017
- A developer account with the application identifier and secret key for one of the following social media authentication services:

  - Microsoft Accounts ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070))
  - Twitter ([https://dev.twitter.com/](https://dev.twitter.com/))
  - Facebook ([https://developers.facebook.com/](https://developers.facebook.com/))
  - Google ([https://developers.google.com/](https://developers.google.com))

<a id="USING"></a>
## Using External Authentication Services

The abundance of external authentication services that are currently available to web developers help to reduce development time when creating new web applications. Web users typically have several existing accounts for popular web services and social media websites, therefore when a web application implements the authentication services from an external web service or social media website, it saves the development time that would have been spent creating an authentication implementation. Using an external authentication service saves end users from having to create another account for your web application, and also from having to remember another username and password.

In the past, developers have had two choices: create their own authentication implementation, or learn how to integrate an external authentication service into their applications. At the most basic level, the following diagram illustrates a simple request flow for a user agent (web browser) that is requesting information from a web application that is configured to use an external authentication service:

[![Illustration of a simple request flow for a user agent](external-authentication-services/_static/image2.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image1.png)

In the preceding diagram, the user agent (or web browser in this example) makes a request to a web application, which redirects the web browser to an external authentication service. The user agent sends its credentials to the external authentication service, and if the user agent has successfully authenticated, the external authentication service will redirect the user agent to the original web application with some form of token which the user agent will send to the web application. The web application will use the token to verify that the user agent has been successfully authenticated by the external authentication service, and the web application may use the token to gather more information about the user agent. Once the application is done processing the user agent's information, the web application will return the appropriate response to the user agent based on its authorization settings.

In this second example, the user agent negotiates with the web application and external authorization server, and the web application performs additional communication with the external authorization server to retrieve additional information about the user agent:

[![Illustration of user agent negotiating with the web application](external-authentication-services/_static/image4.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image3.png)

Visual Studio 2017 and ASP.NET 4.7.2 make integration with external authentication services easier for developers by providing built-in integration for the following authentication services:

- Facebook
- Google
- Microsoft Accounts (Windows Live ID accounts)
- Twitter

The examples in this walkthrough will demonstrate how to configure each of the supported external authentication services by using the new ASP.NET Web Application template that ships with Visual Studio 2017.

> [!NOTE]
> If necessary, you may need to add your FQDN to the settings for your external authentication service. This requirement is based on security constraints for some external authentication services which require the FQDN in your application settings to match the FQDN that is used by your clients. (The steps for this will vary greatly for each external authentication service; you will need to consult the documentation for each external authentication service to see if this is required and how to configure these settings.) If you need to configure IIS Express to use an FQDN for testing this environment, see the [Configuring IIS Express to use a Fully Qualified Domain Name](#FQDN) section later in this walkthrough.

<a id="SAMPLE"></a>
## Create a Sample Web Application

The following steps will lead you through creating a sample application by using the ASP.NET Web Application template, and you will use this sample application for each of the external authentication services later in this walkthrough.

Start Visual Studio 2017 and select **New Project** from the Start page. Or, from the **File** menu, select **New** and then **Project**.

<!-- [![](external-authentication-services/_static/image6.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image5.png) -->

When the **New Project** dialog box is displayed, select **Installed** and expand **Visual C#**. Under **Visual C#**, select **Web**. In the list of project templates, select **ASP.NET Web Application (.Net Framework)**. Enter a name for your project and click **OK**.

[![Image of New Project dialog box](external-authentication-services/_static/image71.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image71.png)

When the **New ASP.NET Project** is displayed, select the **Single Page Application** template and click **Create Project**.

[![Image of template selection](external-authentication-services/_static/image72.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image72.png)

Wait as Visual Studio 2017 creates your project.

<!-- [![](external-authentication-services/_static/image12.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image11.png) -->

When Visual Studio 2017 has finished creating your project, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file that is located in the **App\_Start** folder.

When you first create the project, none of the external authentication services are enabled in *Startup.Auth.cs* file; the following illustrates what your code might resemble, with the sections highlighted for where you would enable an external authentication service and any relevant settings in order to use Microsoft Accounts, Twitter, Facebook, or Google authentication with your ASP.NET application:

[!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample1.cs)]

When you press F5 to build and debug your web application, it will display a login screen where you will see that no external authentication services have been defined.

[![Image of login screen](external-authentication-services/_static/image73.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image73.png)

In the following sections, you will learn how to enable each of the external authentication services that are provided with ASP.NET in Visual Studio 2017.

<a id="FACEBOOK"></a>
## Enabling Facebook authentication

Using Facebook authentication requires you to create a Facebook developer account, and your project will require an application ID and secret key from Facebook in order to function. For information about creating a Facebook developer account and obtaining your application ID and secret key, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252166](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252166).

Once you have obtained your application ID and secret key, use the following steps to enable Facebook authentication for your web application:

1. When your project is open in Visual Studio 2017, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file.

2. Locate the Facebook authentication section of code:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample2.cs)]
3. Remove the &quot;//&quot; characters to uncomment the highlighted lines of code, and then add your application ID and secret key. Once you have added those parameters, you can recompile your project:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample3.cs)]
4. When you press F5 to open your web application in your web browser, you will see that Facebook has been defined as an external authentication service:

<a id="GOOGLE"></a>
## Enabling Google Authentication

Using Google authentication requires you to create a Google developer account, and your project will require an application ID and secret key from Google in order to function. For information about creating a Google developer account and obtaining your application ID and secret key, see [https://developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com).

To enable Google authentication for your web application, use the following steps:

1. When your project is open in Visual Studio 2017, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file.

2. Locate the Google authentication section of code:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample4.cs)]
3. Remove the &quot;//&quot; characters to uncomment the highlighted lines of code, and then add your application ID and secret key. Once you have added those parameters, you can recompile your project:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample5.cs)]
4. When you press F5 to open your web application in your web browser, you will see that Google has been defined as an external authentication service:

    [![Image of Google default home page](external-authentication-services/_static/image38.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image37.png)

<a id="MICROSOFT"></a>
## Enabling Microsoft Authentication

Microsoft authentication requires you to create a developer account, and it requires a client ID and client secret in order to function. For information about creating a Microsoft developer account and obtaining your client ID and client secret, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070).

Once you have obtained your consumer key and consumer secret, use the following steps to enable Microsoft authentication for your web application:

1. When your project is open in Visual Studio 2017, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file.

2. Locate the Microsoft authentication section of code:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample6.cs)]
3. Remove the &quot;//&quot; characters to uncomment the highlighted lines of code, and then add your client ID and client secret. Once you have added those parameters, you can recompile your project:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample7.cs)]
4. When you press F5 to open your web application in your web browser, you will see that Microsoft has been defined as an external authentication service:

    [![Image of Microsoft defined](external-authentication-services/_static/image42.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image41.png)

    [![Image of default Microsoft home page](external-authentication-services/_static/image50.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image49.png)

<a id="TWITTER"></a>
## Enabling Twitter Authentication

Twitter authentication requires you to create a developer account, and it requires a consumer key and consumer secret in order to function. For information about creating a Twitter developer account and obtaining your consumer key and consumer secret, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252166](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252166).

Once you have obtained your consumer key and consumer secret, use the following steps to enable Twitter authentication for your web application:

1. When your project is open in Visual Studio 2017, open the *Startup.Auth.cs* file.

2. Locate the Twitter authentication section of code:

    [!code-csharp[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample8.cs)]

<a id="COMBINE"></a>
### Combining External Authentication Services

For greater flexibility, you can define multiple external authentication services at the same time - this allows your web application's users to use an account from any of the enabled external authentication services:

[![Image of multiple external authentication services](external-authentication-services/_static/image62.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image61.png)

<a id="FQDN"></a>
### Configure IIS Express to use a fully qualified domain name

Some external authentication providers do not support testing your application by using an HTTP address like `http://localhost:port/`. To work around this issue, you can add a static Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) mapping to your HOSTS file and configure your project options in Visual Studio 2017 to use the FQDN for testing/debugging. To do so, use the following steps:

- Add a static FQDN mapping your HOSTS file:

  1. Open an elevated command prompt in Windows.
  2. Type the following command:

      <kbd>notepad %WinDir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</kbd>
  3. Add an entry like the following to the HOSTS file:

      <kbd>127.0.0.1 www.wingtiptoys.com</kbd>
  4. Save and close your HOSTS file.

- Configure your Visual Studio project to use the FQDN:

  1. When your project is open in Visual Studio 2017, click the **Project** menu, and then select your project's properties. For example, you might select **WebApplication1 Properties**.
  2. Select the **Web** tab.
  3. Enter your FQDN for the <strong>Project Url</strong>. For example, you would enter <kbd><http://www.wingtiptoys.com></kbd> if that was the FQDN mapping that you added to your HOSTS file.

- Configure IIS Express to use the FQDN for your application:

    1. Open an elevated command prompt in Windows.
    2. Type the following command to change to your IIS Express folder:

        <kbd>cd /d &quot;%ProgramFiles%\IIS Express&quot;</kbd>
    3. Type the following command to add the FQDN to your application:

        <kbd>appcmd.exe set config -section:system.applicationHost/sites /+&quot;[name='WebApplication1'].bindings.[protocol='http',bindingInformation='*:80:www.wingtiptoys.com']&quot; /commit:apphost</kbd>

  Where **WebApplication1** is the name of your project and **bindingInformation** contains the port number and FQDN that you want to use for your testing.

### How to Obtain your Application Settings for Microsoft Authentication

Linking an application to Windows Live for Microsoft Authentication is a simple process. If you have not already linked an application to Windows Live, you can use the following steps:

1. Browse to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=144070) and enter your Microsoft account name and password when prompted, then click **Sign in**:

   <!--  [![](external-authentication-services/_static/image64.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image63.png) -->
2. Select **Add an app** and enter the name of your application when prompted, and then click **Create**:

    [![Image of add an app](external-authentication-services/_static/image79.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image79.png)
3. Select your app under **Name** and its application properties page appears.

4. Enter the redirect domain for your application. Copy the **Application ID** and, under **Application Secrets**, select **Generate Password**. Copy the password that appears. The application ID and password are your client ID and client secret. Select **Ok** and then **Save**.

    [![Image of redirect domain information](external-authentication-services/_static/image77.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image77.png)

<a id="DISABLE"></a>
### Optional: Disable Local Registration

The current ASP.NET local registration functionality does not prevent automated programs (bots) from creating member accounts; for example, by using a bot-prevention and validation technology like [CAPTCHA](../../../web-pages/overview/security/16-adding-security-and-membership.md). Because of this, you should remove the local login form and registration link on the login page. To do so, open the *\_Login.cshtml* page in your project, and then comment out the lines for the local login panel and the registration link. The resulting page should look like the following code sample:

[!code-html[Main](external-authentication-services/samples/sample10.html)]

Once the local login panel and the registration link have been disabled, your login page will only display the external authentication providers that you have enabled:

[![Image of external providers only login](external-authentication-services/_static/image70.png "Click to Expand the Image")](external-authentication-services/_static/image69.png)
