# Build RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Web API

by [Web Camps Team](https://twitter.com/webcamps)

> Hands on lab: Use Web API in ASP.NET 4.x to build a simple REST API for a contact manager application. You will also build a client to consume the API.

In recent years, it has become clear that HTTP is not just for serving up HTML pages. It is also a powerful platform for building Web APIs, using a handful of verbs (GET, POST, and so forth) plus a few simple concepts such as *URIs* and *headers*. ASP.NET Web API is a set of components that simplify HTTP programming. Because it is built on top of the ASP.NET MVC runtime, Web API automatically handles the low-level transport details of HTTP. At the same time, Web API naturally exposes the HTTP programming model. In fact, one goal of Web API is to *not* abstract away the reality of HTTP. As a result, Web API is both flexible and easy to extend.  The REST architectural style has proven to be an effective way to leverage HTTP - although it is certainly not the only valid approach to HTTP. The contact manager will expose the RESTful for listing, adding and removing contacts, among others. 

This lab requires a basic understanding of HTTP, REST, and assumes you have a basic working knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and jQuery.

      > One of the advantages of using NuGet is that you don't have to ship all the libraries in your project, reducing the project size. With NuGet Power Tools, by specifying the package versions in the Packages.config file, you will be able to download all the required libraries the first time you run the project. This is why you will have to run these steps after you open an existing solution from this lab.
3. Open the **Services/ContactRepository.cs** file.

<a id="Ex2Task2"></a>

<a id="Task_2_-_Adding_Data-Persistence_Features_to_the_Contact_Repository_Implementation"></a>
#### Task 2 - Adding Data-Persistence Features to the Contact Repository Implementation

In this task, you will augment the ContactRepository class of the Web API project created in Exercise 1 so that it can persist and accept user input and new Contact instances.

1. Add the following constant to the **ContactRepository** class to represent the name of the web server cache item key name later in this exercise.

    [!code-csharp[Main](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/samples/sample9.cs)]
2. Add a constructor to the **ContactRepository** containing the following code.

    (Code Snippet - *Web API Lab - Ex02 - Get All Contacts*)

    [!code-csharp[Main](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/samples/sample11.cs)]

    > [!NOTE]
    > This example is for demonstration purposes and will use the web server's cache as a storage medium, so that the values will be available to multiple clients simultaneously, rather than use a Session storage mechanism or a Request storage lifetime. One could use Entity Framework, XML storage, or any other variety in place of the web server cache.
4. Implement a new method named **SaveContact** to the **ContactRepository** class to do the work of saving a contact. The **SaveContact** method should take a single **Contact** parameter and return a Boolean value indicating success or failure.

    (Code Snippet - *Web API Lab - Ex02 - Implementing the SaveContact Method*)

<a id="Summary"></a>
## Summary

This lab has introduced you to the new ASP.NET Web API framework and to the implementation of RESTful Web APIs using the framework. From here, you could create a new repository that facilitates data persistence using any number of mechanisms and wire that service up rather than the simple one provided as an example in this lab. Web API supports a number of additional features, such as enabling communication from non-HTML clients written in any language that supports HTTP and JSON or XML. The ability to host a Web API outside of a typical web application is also possible, as well as is the ability to create your own serialization formats.

The ASP.NET Web site has an area dedicated to the ASP.NET Web API framework at [[https://asp.net/web-api](https://asp.net/web-api)](https://asp.net/web-api). This site will continue to provide late-breaking information, samples, and news related to Web API, so check it frequently if you'd like to delve deeper into the art of creating custom Web APIs available to virtually any device or development framework.

<a id="Task_1_-_Creating_a_New_Web_Site_from_the_Windows_Azure_Portal"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a New Web Site from the Azure Portal

1. Go to the [Azure Management Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and sign in using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

    > [!NOTE]
    > With Azure you can host 10 ASP.NET Web Sites for free and then scale as your traffic grows. You can sign up [here](https://aka.ms/aspnet-hol-azure).

    ![Log on to Windows Azure portal](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/_static/image39.png "Log on to Windows Azure portal")

    *Log on to Portal*
2. Click **New** on the command bar.

    *Opening the Web Site management pages*
7. In the **Dashboard** page, under the **quick glance** section, click the **Download publish profile** link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *publish profile* contains all of the information required to publish a web application to a Azure for each enabled publication method. The publish profile contains the URLs, user credentials and database strings required to connect to and authenticate against each of the endpoints for which a publication method is enabled. **Microsoft WebMatrix 2**, **Microsoft Visual Studio Express for Web** and **Microsoft Visual Studio 2012** support reading publish profiles to automate configuration of these programs for publishing web applications to Azure.

    ![Downloading the web site publish profile](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/_static/image45.png "Downloading the web site publish profile")

    *Downloading the Web Site publish profile*

<a id="Task_2_-_Configuring_the_Database_Server"></a>
#### Task 2 - Configuring the Database Server

If your application makes use of SQL Server databases you will need to create a SQL Database server. If you want to deploy a simple application that does not use SQL Server you might skip this task.

1. You will need a SQL Database server for storing the application database. You can view the SQL Database servers from your subscription in the Azure Management portal at **Sql Databases** | **Servers** | **Server's Dashboard**. If you do not have a server created, you can create one using the **Add** button on the command bar. Take note of the **server name and URL, administrator login name and password**, as you will use them in the next tasks. Do not create the database yet, as it will be created in a later stage.

    ![SQL Database Server Dashboard](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/_static/image47.png "SQL Database Server Dashboard")

    *SQL Database Server Dashboard*
2. In the next task you will test the database connection from Visual Studio, for that reason you need to include your local IP address in the server's list of **Allowed IP Addresses**. To do that, click **Configure**, select the IP address from **Current Client IP Address** and paste it on the **Start IP Address** and **End IP Address** text boxes and click the ![add-client-ip-address-ok-button](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/_static/image48.png) button.

    ![Adding Client IP Address](build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api/_static/image49.png)
