LocalDB was created specifically for the development environment. It doesn't require a password, therefore you don't need to do anything to prevent secrets from being checked into your source code. Some development teams use the full versions of SQL Server (or other DBMS) that require a password.

By default, EF generates additional SQL operators to make equality between null values work in the database like it works in memory, but you can set the [UseDatabaseNullSemantics](/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.infrastructure.dbcontextconfiguration.usedatabasenullsemantics) flag in EF6 or call the 
  95: [UseRelationalNulls](/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.infrastructure.relationaldbcontextoptionsbuilder-2.userelationalnulls) method in EF Core to configure this behavior.

mvc\overview\getting-started\introduction\adding-a-model.md:
  19  
  20: You'll use a .NET Framework data-access technology known as the [Entity Framework](/ef/) to define and work with these model classes. The Entity Framework (often referred to as EF) supports a development paradigm called *Code First*. Code First allows you to create model objects by writing simple classes. (These are also known as POCO classes, from &quot;plain-old CLR objects.&quot;) You can then have the database created on the fly from your classes, which enables a very clean and rapid development workflow. If you are required to create the database first, you can still follow this tutorial to learn about MVC and EF app development. You can then follow Tom Fizmakens [ASP.NET Scaffolding](xref:visual-studio/overview/2013/aspnet-scaffolding-overview) tutorial, which covers the database first approach.

mvc\overview\getting-started\introduction\adding-a-view.md:
  140  
  141: In the sample above, we used a `ViewBag` object to pass data from the controller to a view. Later in the tutorial, we will use a view model to pass data from a controller to a view. The view model approach to passing data is generally much preferred over the view bag approach. See the blog entry [Dynamic V Strongly Typed Views](/archive/blogs/rickandy/dynamic-v-strongly-typed-views) for more information. 
  142  

mvc\overview\getting-started\introduction\adding-search.md:
  124  
  125: The code uses the `AddRange` method of the generic `List` collection to add all the distinct genres to the list. (Without the `Distinct` modifier, duplicate genres would be added — for example, comedy would be added twice in our sample). The code then stores the list of genres in the `ViewBag.MovieGenre` object. Storing category data (such a movie genres) as a [SelectList](/dotnet/api/system.web.mvc.selectlist) object in a `ViewBag`, then accessing the category data in a dropdown list box is a typical approach for MVC applications.
  126  

mvc\overview\getting-started\introduction\creating-a-connection-string.md:
  19  
  20: The `MovieDBContext` class you created handles the task of connecting to the database and mapping `Movie` objects to database records. One question you might ask, though, is how to specify which database it will connect to. You don't actually have to specify which database to use, Entity Framework will default to using [LocalDB](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-2016-express-localdb). In this section we'll explicitly add a connection string in the *Web.config* file of the application.
  21  

  23  
  24: [LocalDB](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-2016-express-localdb) is a lightweight version of the SQL Server Express Database Engine that starts on demand and runs in user mode. LocalDB runs in a special execution mode of SQL Server Express that enables you to work with databases as *.mdf* files. Typically, LocalDB database files are kept in the *App\_Data* folder of a web project.

  69: The [DropDownList](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd492738.aspx) helper used to create an HTML select list requires a **IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem &gt;**, either explicitly or implicitly. That is, you can pass the **IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem &gt;** explicitly to the [DropDownList](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd492738.aspx) helper or you can add the **IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem &gt;** to the [ViewBag](/archive/blogs/rickandy/dynamic-v-strongly-typed-views) using the same name for the **SelectListItem** as the model property. Passing in the **SelectListItem** implicitly and explicitly is covered in the next part of the tutorial. The code above shows the simplest possible way to create an **IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem &gt;** and populate it with text and values. Note the `Comedy`[SelectListItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.selectlistitem.aspx) has the [Selected](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.mvc.selectlistitem.selected.aspx) property set to **true;** this will cause the rendered select list to show **Comedy** as the selected item in the list.

  219: The browser limitation of six simultaneous connections per each hostname can be mitigated by using a [CDN](/archive/blogs/rickandy/using-cdns-and-expires-to-improve-web-site-performance). Because the CDN will have a different hostname than your hosting site, asset requests from the CDN will not count against the six simultaneous connections limit to your hosting environment. A CDN can also provide common package caching and edge caching advantages.

  172  - If your application is using web services or System.NET to communicate with a backend over HTTP you may need to increase the [connectionManagement/maxconnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb6y0fyc(VS.110).aspx) element. For ASP.NET applications, this is limited by the autoConfig feature to 12 times the number of CPUs. That means that on a quad-proc, you can have at most 12 \* 4 = 48 concurrent connections to an IP end point. Because this is tied to [autoConfig](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7w2sway1(VS.110).aspx), the easiest way to increase `maxconnection` in an ASP.NET application is to set [System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit(VS.110).aspx) programmatically in the from `Application_Start` method in the *global.asax* file. See the sample download for an example.

  178: The anti-XSRF routines currently do not defend against [clickjacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking). Applications that wish to defend themselves against clickjacking may easily do so by sending an X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN header with each response. This header is supported by all recent browsers. For more information, see the [IE blog](/archive/blogs/ieinternals/combating-clickjacking-with-x-frame-options), the [SDL blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2009/02/05/clickjacking-defense-in-ie8/), and [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking). The ASP.NET Web Stack Runtime may in some future release make the MVC and Web Pages anti-XSRF helpers automatically set this header so that applications are automatically protected against this attack.

SameSite\owin-samesite.md:
  78  The 2016 `SameSite` standard mandated that unknown values must be treated as `SameSite=Strict` values. Apps accessed from older browsers which support the 2016 `SameSite` standard may break when they get a `SameSite` property with a value of `None`. Web apps must implement browser detection if they intend to support older browsers. ASP.NET doesn't implement browser detection because User-Agents values are highly volatile and change frequently. An extension point in [ICookieManager](/previous-versions/aspnet/dn800238(v%3Dvs.113)) allows plugging in User-Agent specific logic.

To support partial updates, the OData specification defined the MERGE method. In 2010, [RFC 5789](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) defined the PATCH method for partial updates. You can read some of the history in this [blog post](/archive/blogs/astoriateam/merge-vs-replace-semantics-for-update-operations) on the WCF Data Services Blog. Today, PATCH is preferred over MERGE.

  200  - If your application is using web services or System.NET to communicate with a backend over HTTP you may need to increase the [connectionManagement/maxconnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb6y0fyc(VS.110).aspx) element. For ASP.NET applications, this is limited by the autoConfig feature to 12 times the number of CPUs. That means that on a quad-proc, you can have at most 12 \* 4 = 48 concurrent connections to an IP end point. Because this is tied to [autoConfig](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7w2sway1(VS.110).aspx), the easiest way to increase `maxconnection` in an ASP.NET application is to set [System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.defaultconnectionlimit(VS.110).aspx) programmatically in the from `Application_Start` method in the *global.asax* file. See the sample download for an example.
