# Unit Testing Controllers in ASP.NET Web API 2

by [Mike Wasson](https://github.com/MikeWasson)

> This topic describes some specific techniques for unit testing controllers in Web API 2. Before reading this topic, you might want to read the tutorial [Unit Testing ASP.NET Web API 2](unit-testing-with-aspnet-web-api.md), which shows how to add a unit-test project to your solution.

A common pattern in unit tests is &quot;arrange-act-assert&quot;:

- Arrange: Set up any prerequisites for the test to run.
- Act: Perform the test.
- Assert: Verify that the test succeeded.

In the arrange step, you will often use mock or stub objects. That minimizes the number of dependencies, so the test is focused on testing one thing.

Here are some things that you should unit test in your Web API controllers:

- The action returns the correct type of response.
- Invalid parameters return the correct error response.
- The action calls the correct method on the repository or service layer.
- If the response includes a domain model, verify the model type.

These are some of the general things to test, but the specifics depend on your controller implementation. In particular, it makes a big difference whether your controller actions return **HttpResponseMessage** or **IHttpActionResult**. For more information about these result types, see [Action Results in Web Api 2](../getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/action-results.md).

## Testing Actions that Return HttpResponseMessage

Here is an example of a controller whose actions return **HttpResponseMessage**.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample1.cs)]

Notice the controller uses dependency injection to inject an `IProductRepository`. That makes the controller more testable, because you can inject a mock repository. The following unit test verifies that the `Get` method writes a `Product` to the response body. Assume that `repository` is a mock `IProductRepository`.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample2.cs)]

It's important to set **Request** and **Configuration** on the controller. Otherwise, the test will fail with an **ArgumentNullException** or **InvalidOperationException**.

## Testing Link Generation

The `Post` method calls **UrlHelper.Link** to create links in the response. This requires a little more setup in the unit test:

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample3.cs)]

The **UrlHelper** class needs the request URL and route data, so the test has to set values for these. Another option is mock or stub **UrlHelper**. With this approach, you replace the default value of [ApiController.Url](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.http.apicontroller.url.aspx) with a mock or stub version that returns a fixed value.

Let's rewrite the test using the [Moq](https://github.com/Moq) framework. Install the `Moq` NuGet package in the test project.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample4.cs)]

In this version, you don't need to set up any route data, because the mock **UrlHelper** returns a constant string.

## Testing Actions that Return IHttpActionResult

In Web API 2, a controller action can return **IHttpActionResult**, which is analogous to **ActionResult** in ASP.NET MVC. The **IHttpActionResult** interface defines a command pattern for creating HTTP responses. Instead of creating the response directly, the controller returns an **IHttpActionResult**. Later, the pipeline invokes the **IHttpActionResult** to create the response. This approach makes it easier to write unit tests, because you can skip a lot of the setup that is needed for **HttpResponseMessage**.

Here is an example controller whose actions return **IHttpActionResult**.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample5.cs)]

This example shows some common patterns using **IHttpActionResult**. Let's see how to unit test them.

### Action returns 200 (OK) with a response body

The `Get` method calls `Ok(product)` if the product is found. In the unit test, make sure the return type is **OkNegotiatedContentResult** and the returned product has the right ID.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample6.cs)]

Notice that the unit test doesn't execute the action result. You can assume the action result creates the HTTP response correctly. (That's why the Web API framework has its own unit tests!)

### Action returns 404 (Not Found)

The `Get` method calls `NotFound()` if the product is not found. For this case, the unit test just checks if the return type is **NotFoundResult**.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample7.cs)]

### Action returns 200 (OK) with no response body

The `Delete` method calls `Ok()` to return an empty HTTP 200 response. Like the previous example, the unit test checks the return type, in this case **OkResult**.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample8.cs)]

### Action returns 201 (Created) with a Location header

The `Post` method calls `CreatedAtRoute` to return an HTTP 201 response with a URI in the Location header. In the unit test, verify that the action sets the correct routing values.

[!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-controllers-in-web-api/samples/sample9.cs)]

### Action returns another 2xx with a response body

The `Put` method calls `Content` to return an HTTP 202 (Accepted) response with a response body. This case is similar to returning 200 (OK), but the unit test should also check the status code.
