Chapter of an e-book about developing for the cloud. Introduces NoSQL databases as an alternative that many developers familiar with relational databases tend to overlook. Presents guidelines on what to think about when choosing relational or NoSQL, or choosing a particular platform.
- [ASP.NET Data Access Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms178359.aspx) (MSDN). An introduction to data access options for relational databases for ASP.NET and guidance on how to choose platforms and access methods that are appropriate for your scenario.
- [Relational database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). Wikipedia). If you haven't worked with relational databases, see this page for an introduction to relational database terminology and concepts.

<a id="cf"></a>

### Using Entity Framework Code First

The following tutorials offer downloadable sample applications:

- [Getting Started with EF 6 using MVC 5](../mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md). Covers a wide range of Entity Framework Code First scenarios, including Migrations and EF 6 features such as connection resiliency, command interception, and async. This is an updated version of the [EF 5 / MVC 4 series](../mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application.md). The earlier series includes a tutorial on the repository and unit-of-work patterns that is not included in the new series.
- [Introduction to ASP.NET MVC 5](../mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started.md). Covers a narrower range of Entity Framework Code First scenarios but does a more comprehensive job of introducing MVC features.
- [Model Binding and Web Forms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=286117). Uses Code First in a Web Forms application.
- [Getting Started with ASP.NET 4.5 Web Forms](../web-forms/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-aspnet-45-web-forms/introduction-and-overview.md). An introduction to Web Forms with some coverage of Code First. Uses Model Binding.
- [MVC Music Store](../mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1.md). Uses Code First in an e-commerce MVC 3 application that also implements membership and authorization. The MVC version and ASP.NET membership (authentication and authorization) system used here are outdated; for more up-to-date information on ASP.NET membership, see [https://asp.net/identity](https://asp.net/identity).

<a id="efrepository"></a><a id="efbooks"></a>

### Books about the Entity Framework

- [Programming Entity Framework: DbContext](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022237.do) by Julie Lerman and Rowan Miller.
- [Programming Entity Framework: Code First](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022220.do) by Julie Lerman and Rowan Miller.

Both of these books are up-to-date with current recommended techniques. They provide a more comprehensive yet easy-to-follow introduction to the Entity Framework than anything available on the Internet. Another book, [Programming Entity Framework](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596807252.do) by Julie Lerman, is larger and more comprehensive but it is older and many of the techniques it covers are no longer the recommended way to use the Entity Framework.
