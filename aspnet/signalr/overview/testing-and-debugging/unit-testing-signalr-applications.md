## Unit testing SignalR applications

You can use the unit test features in SignalR 2 to create unit tests for your SignalR application. SignalR 2 includes the [IHubCallerConnectionContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.aspnet.signalr.hubs.ihubcallerconnectioncontext(v=vs.118).aspx) interface, which can be used to create a mock object to simulate your hub methods for testing.

In this section, you'll add unit tests for the application created in the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr.md) using [XUnit.net](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) and [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4).

XUnit.net will be used to control the test; Moq will be used to create a [mock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) object for testing. Other mocking frameworks can be used if desired; [NSubstitute](http://nsubstitute.github.io/) is also a good choice. This tutorial demonstrates how to set up the mock object in two ways: First, using a `dynamic` object (introduced in .NET Framework 4), and second, using an interface.

This tutorial contains the following sections.

### Unit testing with Dynamic

In this section, you'll add a unit test for the application created in the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr.md) using a dynamic object.

1. Install the [XUnit Runner extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/463c5987-f82b-46c8-a97e-b1cde42b9099) for Visual Studio 2013.
2. Either complete the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr.md), or download the completed application from [MSDN Code Gallery](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/SignalR-Getting-Started-b9d18aa9).
3. If you are using the download version of the Getting Started application, open **Package Manager Console** and click **Restore** to add the SignalR package to the project.

4. Add a project to the solution for the unit test. Right-click your solution in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Project...**. Under the **C#** node, select the **Windows** node. Select **Class Library**. Name the new project **TestLibrary** and click **OK**.

    ![Create Test Library](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image2.png)
5. Add a reference in the test library project to the SignalRChat project. Right-click the **TestLibrary** project and select **Add**, **Reference...**. Select the **Projects** node under the **Solution** node, and check **SignalRChat**. Click **OK**.

    ![Add Project Reference](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image3.png)
6. Add the SignalR, Moq, and XUnit packages to the **TestLibrary** project. In the **Package Manager Console**, set the **Default Project** dropdown to **TestLibrary**. Run the following commands in the console window:

   - `Install-Package Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR`
   - `Install-Package Moq`
   - `Install-Package XUnit`

     ![Install Packages](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image4.png)
7. Create the test file. Right-click the **TestLibrary** project and click **Add...**, **Class**. Name the new class **Tests.cs**.
8. Replace the contents of Tests.cs with the following code.

    [!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-signalr-applications/samples/sample1.cs)]

    In the code above, a test client is created using the `Mock` object from the [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4) library, of type [IHubCallerConnectionContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.aspnet.signalr.hubs.ihubcallerconnectioncontext(v=vs.118).aspx) (in SignalR 2.1, assign `dynamic` for the type parameter.) The `IHubCallerConnectionContext` interface is the proxy object with which you invoke methods on the client. The `broadcastMessage` function is then defined for the mock client so that it can be called by the `ChatHub` class. The test engine then calls the `Send` method of the `ChatHub` class, which in turn calls the mocked `broadcastMessage` function.
9. Build the solution by pressing **F6**.
10. Run the unit test. In Visual Studio, select **Test**, **Windows**, **Test Explorer**. In the Test Explorer window, right-click **HubsAreMockableViaDynamic** and select **Run Selected Tests**.

    ![Screenshot showing HubsAreMockableViaDynamic selected in the Test Explorer window.](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image5.png)
11. Verify that the test passed by checking the lower pane in the Test Explorer window. The window will show that the test passed.

### Unit testing by type

In this section, you'll add a test for the application created in the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-getting-started-with-signalr.md) using an interface that contains the method to be tested.

1. Complete steps 1-7 in the [Unit testing with Dynamic](#dynamic) tutorial above.
2. Replace the contents of Tests.cs with the following code.

    [!code-csharp[Main](unit-testing-signalr-applications/samples/sample2.cs)]

    In the code above, an interface is created defining the signature of the `broadcastMessage` method for which the test engine will create a mock client. A mock client is then created using the `Mock` object, of type [IHubCallerConnectionContext](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.aspnet.signalr.hubs.ihubcallerconnectioncontext(v=vs.118).aspx) (in SignalR 2.1, assign `dynamic` for the type parameter.) The `IHubCallerConnectionContext` interface is the proxy object with which you invoke methods on the client.

    The test then creates an instance of `ChatHub`, and then creates a mock version of the `broadcastMessage` method, which in turn is invoked by calling the `Send` method on the hub.
3. Build the solution by pressing **F6**.
4. Run the unit test. In Visual Studio, select **Test**, **Windows**, **Test Explorer**. In the Test Explorer window, right-click **HubsAreMockableViaDynamic** and select **Run Selected Tests**.

    ![Screenshot showing HubsAreMockableViaType selected in the Test Explorer window.](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image7.png)
5. Verify that the test passed by checking the lower pane in the Test Explorer window. The window will show that the test passed.

    ![Screenshot showing the unit test by type has passed.](unit-testing-signalr-applications/_static/image8.png)
