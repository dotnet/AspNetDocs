## Enforce authorization

To enforce authorization rules when using a [PersistentConnection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.aspnet.signalr.persistentconnection(v=vs.111).aspx) you must override the `AuthorizeRequest` method. You cannot use the `Authorize` attribute with persistent connections. The `AuthorizeRequest` method is called by the SignalR Framework before every request to verify that the user is authorized to perform the requested action. The `AuthorizeRequest` method is not called from the client; instead, you authenticate the user through your application's standard authentication mechanism.

The example below shows how to limit requests to authenticated users.

You can add any customized authorization logic in the AuthorizeRequest method; such as, checking whether a user belongs to a particular role.
